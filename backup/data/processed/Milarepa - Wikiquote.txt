I attain all my knowledge through
studying my mind within, thus all my
thoughts become the teachings of
Dharma. So long as I do not become
separated from my own mind, I am
always accompanied by sutras. I have
realized that all manifestations are Mind,
and the mind itself is the illumination.
Milarepa
Jetsun Milarepa (Tibetan: རྗེ་བཙུན་མི་ལ་རས་པ, Wylie: rje btsun
mi la ras pa), (c. 1052 – c. 1135 CE) was a famous poet and
yogi of Tibet. He was a student of Marpa Lotsawa, and a
major figure in the history of the Kagyu school of Tibetan
Buddhism.
Having meditated on gentleness and on compassion,
I have forgotten the difference between myself and
others.
From the song offered to Geshe Tsaphoua, as
quoted in Meditation Techniques of the Buddhist
and Taoist Masters (2003) by Daniel Odier, p. 104
(https://books.google.it/books?id=9BXTAwAAQBAJ
&pg=PA104)
In my youth I committed black deeds. In maturity I
practised innocence. Now, released from both good
and evil, I have destroyed the root of karmic action and
shall have no reason for action in the future. To say
more than this would only cause weeping and
laughter. What good would it do to tell you? I am an
old man. Leave me in peace.
As quoted in The Life of Milarepa: A New
Translation from the Tibetan (1977) by Tsangnyön
Heruka, as translated by Lobsang P. Lhalungpa, p. 12
as translated and edited by Garma C. C. Chang (1975)
For those who do not guard their morals,
Prayers are but wishful thinking.
For those who do not practice what they preach,
Oratory is but faithless lying.
p. 17

I pray to all accomplished beings;
I pray you to extinguish the Five Poisonous Klesas.
You man with a human body but a demon's face,
Listen to me. Listen to the song of Milarepa!
Men say the human body is most precious, like a gem;
There is nothing that is precious about you.
You sinful man with a demon's look,
Though you desire the pleasures of this life,
Because of your sins, you will never gain them.
But if you renounce desires within,
You will win the Great Accomplishment.
It is difficult to conquer oneself
While vanquishing the outer world;
Conquer now your own Self-mind.
To slay this deer will never please you,
But if you kill the Five Poisons within,
All your wishes will be fulfilled.
If ones tries to vanquish foes in the outer world,
They increase in greater measure.
If one conquers his Self-mind within,
All his foes soon disappear.
Do not spend your life committing sinful deeds;
It is good for you to practice holy Dharma.
Milarepa sent word that all who had known him and had faith in him, and those who
wished to meet him, should come.
For many days Milarepa held a discourse on the law of karma and the nature of reality. To
everyone present, all kinds of phenomena appeared, all heard exquisite music, wonderful
odors filled the air and rainbows arched the clear blue sky. A great happiness pervaded the
whole assembly... Surrounded by his disciples Milarepa entered a deep state of meditation.
Thus he passed away at the age of eighty four.
