We met in Darjeeling, a resort town in the foothills of the Himalaya Mountains. He had just come from Tibet, a \ndistance which, though not far from Darjeeling, has to be measured \nin the number of days' travel by horses and yaks. Tibet was then a \ngreat mystery and source of curiosity to most people; the country was \nstill closed to foreigners and only a few Europeans had been there. \nThe barrier, however, was less stringent on the Chinese side. With \nthis advantage, Mr. Chang had left China for Tibet in the late 1930's \nto search for Dharma and Enlightenment. He traveled extensively in \nthe Kham region of Tibet and studied Buddhism in various monasteries for more than eight years. His fascinating and inspiring adventures in this \"innermost part of Tibet\" are a matter for another book. \nBecause of his long years of study and practice in Tibet, his personal \ndevotion and committment to Buddhism, and his first-hand experience \nof the lives of the Tibetan people, he is best qualified to translate this \ngreat Tibetan classic, The Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa, \nwhich, up to the present, has not appeared in complete translation \nin any Western language. \nBut what contribution has this book to make to a modern man, \nwith no time to read, who has already been swamped in a flood of \nbooks? To answer this question, some relevant facts should first be \nreviewed. \nIf the average modern man is asked what he is living for, and what \nis the aim of his striving, he will probably tell you, with some embarrassment, that he lives \"to enjoy life,\" \"to support his family,\" \"to \nhave fun,\" \"to make money,\" or \"to achieve something meaningful \nand worthwhile.\" But in reality, we are all aware that no one seems \nto know exactly what he is living for. If he broods over the things \nsurrounding him and the kind of world he is living in, he will soon become skeptical about the relevance of raising these questions. He cannot help but ask honestly, \"Can we really know the right answers, do \nwe have any choice over these matters, and after all, what difference \nwill it make?\" \nIn spite of the unavoidable resignation and bewilderment that the \nmodem man feels, sooner or later he finds himself compelled to choose \nbetween two alternatives: he can either turn to religion with blind \nIX", "tokens": 538, "page_debut": null}

On the other hand, they choose the \nlatter, not because they have proved the untruth of religion, but because, in all likelihood, their spirits are deadened by pessimism and \nindifference. One fact, however, remains clear: in both cases the \nchoice is made under the coercion of pain, sorrow, or despair. \nIt is common knowledge that an awareness of impending peril stirs \nmen to act and to strive, that an awakening to man's limitations and \nhelplessness in the face of the Universe, inspires him to pursue the \"beyond\" and the eternal. Thus both heaven and earth, \nNirviii:~a and \nSarpsara, owe their births to human sufferings and despair. A thoughtful man must ask: \"Is it really advantageous to lead a life without \nany suffering? Are not misfortune and grief prerequisites for spiritual \nawakening? From the ultimate viewpoint, are we, the sophisticated \n'men-of-abundant-knowledge-and-possessions,' truly better off than the \n'men-of-ignorance-and-scarcity' of olden times?\" Let us think twice before we give an affirmative answer to these questions. Let us also ponder \non some further ones: \"Is it not true that science and technology, at \ntheir best, can alleviate but not eliminate the sufferings of men? Can \nplastic surgery, or the 'face-lift,' really make a miserable old woman \nhappy? Does it really matter much whether or not we can defer our \nentrance into the grave for ten or fifteen years beyond schedule?\" \nMany ingenious devices have been invented to conceal the unpleasant \nfacts of life, and many gadgets have been created to gratify men's \ninsatiable desires; but in the final analysis, what else have these contrivances brought us save their contributions to a fool's paradise for \nmen to live in? Science, as some wise man has said, \"makes major \ncontributions to minor needs.\" Religion, whether or not it comes up \nwith anything, at least is at work on the things that are truly important. \nDeluded by material achievements and comforts, the majority of \nmodem men are deprived of the opportunity and privileges of leading \na rich spiritual life as their forefathers once did. In just reading a few \nstories of this great Tibetan classic, The Hundred Thousand Songs of \nMilarepa, we can readily find evidence that it was immeasurably easier for the \"backward\" Tibetans to contact the spiritual verities and to \nlead devotional lives than for their more \"advanced\" contemporaries. \nThe reason for this is apparent: They had much simpler minds and \nthey led much simpler lives. Being closer to the sheer facts of life \nuncloaked by camouflage and disguises, they had more opportunity \nto observe its sufferings and transiency; and in closer contact with \nGurus and Saints they could draw more inspiration from them as", "tokens": 673, "page_debut": null}

But \nthe majority of modern men are deprived of these privileges, for they are \nliving in a civilization which a keen observer has wisely defined as \n\"one vast conspiracy against the spiritual life.\" And so the wave of \nKarma keeps on rolling, and one is swept along by it regardless of his \nunwillingness and dismay. No one is foolish enough to think that the \nworld will reverse itself and return to \"the good old days\"; what is \ngone is gone. All one can do, perhaps, is to make use of the best that \nthe past has bequeathed us and apply it to the future and to the \n\"here and now.\" Any person, message, or action that may spark a \nspiritual inspiration for men who must live in this age of spiritual undernourishment should, therefore, be of great value to all concerned, \nbecause they are what we need most, and what so rarely appear in \nour time. \nWith this view in mind, Mr. Chang has spent many years in preparing the English translation of this great spiritual classic of Tibet, \nthe Mila Grubum, or The Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa, in \nthe hope of making it available to the people of the West. \nWhat kind of a book is the Mila Grubum? An adequate answer to \nthis question is extremely difficult to make. Beyond doubt, it is one of \nthe greatest religious classics, ranking with the Mahiibhiirata, the Avataryisaka Sidra, the Old and New Testaments, and the like. But at the \nsame time, it is far more- a different kind of book in its own right, \nand no real parallel can be found in the literary field. Because of its \nunique style, unusual setting, and comprehensive content, the Mila \nGrubum is a book hard to introduce and to appraise in the ordinary \nsense. Therefore, the best answer to the question, \"What kind of a \nbook is this Mila Grubum?\" should be given by the individual reader \nhimself through his own understanding and appreciation. \nI can perhaps speak now for myself as to why, among the many \ngreat religious classics, the Mila Grubum is a personal favorite. To \nname just a few, I may say first of all that I found this book to be \nan inexhaustible fountainhead of inspiration, an immense treasury of \nspiritual teachings, a repository of yogic instructions, a guide on the \nBodhi-Path, and above all, an unfailing friend of the sincere devotee. \nSecondly, it provides inside information on the religious life of the \nTibetan people -\nlaymen, yogis, and monks alike -\npresenting a \nvivid picture of their spiritual problems, strivings, and accomplishments. \nIn this book the profoundest ideas and teachings of Buddhism are revealed in sixty-one fascinating stories presented in simple language. \nThe reading, therefore, is extremely pleasant and interesting.

But when he had gathered a handful of twigs, a sudden storm arose, and the wind was strong enough to blow away the \nwood and tear his ragged robe. When he tried to hold the robe together, the wood blew away. When he tried to clutch the wood, the \nrobe blew apart. [Frustrated}, Milarepa thought, \"Although I have \nbeen practicing the Dharma3 and living in solitude for such a long \ntime, I am still not rid of ego-clinging! What is the use of practicing \nDharma if one cannot subdue ego-clinging? Let the wind blow my \nwood away if it likes. Let the wind blow my robe off if it wishes!\" \nThinking thus, he ceased resisting. But, due to weakness from lack of \nfood, with the next gust of wind he could no longer withstand the \nstorm, and fell down in a faint. \nWh\"en he came to, the storm was over. High up on the branch of \na tree he saw a shred of his clothing swaying in the gentle breeze. \nThe utter futility of this world and all its affairs struck Milarepa, and \na strong· feeling of renunciation overwhelmed him. Sitting down upon \na rock, he meditated once more. \nSoori, a cluster of white clouds rose from Dro Wo Valley4 far \naway to the East. \"Below this bank of clouds lies the temple of my \nGuru, the great Translator Marpa,\"5 mused Milarepa, \"At this very", "tokens": 455, "page_debut": null}

Khyuft. \nGi.rDson.). :\\!though \"mChon\" usually means to leap or jump, here it seems \nbetter to translate it as \"Gem,\" or \"Jewel\"- the other meaning of the word. \n2 Mahamudra (T.T.: Phyag.rGya.Chen.Po.), meaning the \"Great Symbol,\" \nis the practical teaching of Siinyata (Voidness). Siinyata is the principle that \nstresses the non·existence of the \"substance\" of all beings, which is the most important doctrine of Mahayana Buddhism as well as of Tibetan Tantrism. According to some Tibetan scholars, the Madhyamika (Middle Way Doctrine), is a \nteaching of Siinyata in its general form. while Mahamudra is a teaching of Siinyata \nby which one can actually put the Madhyamika principles into practice. Madhyamika is often referred to as the \"Theory of Voidness,\" and 1\\!ahamudra, \"The \nPractice of Voidness.\" \nAt this point a few words on \"Voidness\" may be helpful. When we say ''That \nhouse is empty,\" we mean that it contains no occupants; bot Buddhist ''Voidness\" \ndoes not mean absence. When we say, \"That whole block is now empty,\" we mean \nthere were houses in the block before, but none exist now; but Buddhist \"Void· \nness\" does not mean extinction. Voidness is difficult to define and describe. We \ncan say a great deal about what Voidness is not, but very little about what it is. \nVoidness denotes the relative, flowing, undefinable, and ungraspable nature of all \nthings. Philosophically it represents the illusory and dream-like nature of phenom· \nena; psychologically it signifies a total liberation from all bondage. \nThe Whispered Transmission School (Ghagyuba, T.T.: bKah.rGyud.Pa.) and \nthe Old School (Ningmaba, T.T.: rl\\lin.Ma.Pa.) in Tibet, regard Mahamudra as \nthe highest and most important of all the teachings of Buddhism. But the Yellow \nSchool (Gelugba, T.T.: dGe.Lugs.Pa.) does not entirely agree with this view. \nMahamudra is, in many ways, very similar to Chinese Ch'an (Zen.) See \nthe translator's \"Yogic Commentary\" in \"Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines,\" \n2nd ed., W. Y. Evans-Wentz, Ed., Oxford University Press, London, 1958. \n3 Dharma: This term, most frequently employed in Buddhist literature, \nhas two common usages: to denote the teaching of Buddha, sometimes translated \nas the Law or Doctrine; and to denote being or objects. Here it is used in the \nformer sense. \n4 Dro Wo Valley: the location of Marpa's temple. \n5 Marpa the Translator was Milarepa's teacher. He was a great scholar as well \nas a great yogi, who founded the Oral, or Whispered Transmission School \n(Ghagyuba) of Tibet. \n6 Hevajra: a Sanskrit name; its Tibeta'l equivalent is dGyes.Pa.rDor.rJe. To \nhelp readers who are not familiar with the Tibetan words, many equivalent Sanskrit names and terms are also used in the translation and Notes. \n7 The Four Symbolic Initiations (T.T.: dWan.bShi.): The first initiation is \ncalled 'The Initiation of the Vase.\" The person who has taken it is allowed to \npractice Mantra Yoga. The second is called \"The Secret Initiation,\" and gives \nthe initiate the privilege of practicing Prat:~a Yoga. The third is called \"The \\Vis· \ndom Initiation,\" and allows the initiate to practice advanced \nPrat:~a Yoga. The \nfourth is called \"The Symbolic Initiation,\" and confers the privilege of practicing \nMahamudra Yoga. These four initiations embrace almost all the major teachings \nof Tibetan Tantrism. \n8 The Oral Transmission (T.T.: bKah.rGyud.Pa.), is translated in this book", "tokens": 931, "page_debut": null}

Nhamdog has many mean· \nings, the most common one being \"disturbing thoughts\" or \"Rowing thoughts.\" \nThis constant .Row of thoughts never stops, though men may not be aware of its \nexistence. To curb and halt this unceasing thought-Row is a prerequisite for the attainment of Samadhi. Nhamdog also means wild thoughts, wrong judgements, fan· \ntasy, whims, imagination, impulse, and so forth. \n13 Eight Worldly Winds or Dharmas (T.T.: Chos.brGyad.): the eight \"winds,\" \nor influences, which fan the passions, i.e., gain, loss; ·defamation, eulogy; praise, \nridicule; sorrow, joy. This term is also translated in this book as \"Eight Worldly \nDesires.\" \n14 The Three Precious Ones, or the Three Gems: the Buddha; the Dharma; \nand the Sangha.

Bodhi· \nMind is perhaps the most important term which symbolizes and represents the \ncentral spirit, idea, and principle of Mahayana Buddhism. Because of its manifold \nmeanings and usages, Bodhi-Mind (Skt: Bodhicitta; T.T.: Byan.Chub.Sems.) is ex· \ntremely difficult to translate. Bodhi-Mind can perhaps be roughly described as the \nwish, vow, aspiration, and realization of the noble idea of bringing oneself and all \nsentient beings to the state of great perfection- Buddhahood.

For example, if a man commits murder, he will be punished by his con· \nscience, by the law, by the ruin of his reputation and life, and so on. But this is not \nall. The force of Karma has not yet been exhausted. In a future incarnation, or in· \ncarnations, the murderer will be subjected by this mysterious Karmic force to shorter \nlives and much sickness; or he will be prone to rebirths in times and lands where \nthere are frequent wars and perils. This force, the Karma that ripens in different \nlives, seems to be the most fundamental and mysterious aspect of the Buddhist \ndoctrine. \n7 Fiery Klesas: These are the strong desires and passions that cause all the \npains and distresses of Saf!lsiiric life. \n8 Devoid of thoughts: An accomplished yogi should have freed himself from \nall thoughts or conceptualizations, be they simple or complex, good or evil, monis· \ntic or dualistic ... , then he is said to have acquired the Wisdom of Equality or \nNon-discrimination. \n9 The Realm of Great Light is the realm of primordial Buddhahood.

An accomplished yogi is one who has mastered his Prat;~a·Mind. \n3 See story l, Note 19. \n4 Bardo (T.T.: Bar.Do.): the intermediate state of existence between death \nand rebirth. According to Tibetan Buddhism, this very important state is like a \ncrossroad, the fate and fortune of one's rebirth depending much upon it. \n5 The Bardo of Here·and·Now: From the viewpoint of Tantric teachings, the \nstate of Bardo is not confined to the state after death. This very life itself is a state \nof Bardo. The person in physical existence, as we know it, goes through the same \nexperiences as in Bardo, only in more \"substantial fashion.\" To a Bardo·dweller, it \nis the person in physical existence who seems to be in Bardo, whereas the two states \nof life and death are actually correlative and similar. \n6 The Twenty·eight Constellations (T.T.: rCyu.sKar.Ner.brCyad.; lit.: the \ntwenty-eight running stars): They are the constellations through which the moon \npasses in her revolution round the heavens. \n7 The Eight Planets (T.T.: gZah.brCyad.) refer to the Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, and Rahu (see Story 4, Note 1). \n8 The snowfall is sometimes so heavy in Tibet that all activity. stops. Thus, \neven if one wants to do evil things, one is prevented. \n9 Cotton cloth: The Tantric yogi who practices Heat Yoga is not supposed to \nwear furs -\nhe wears only simple cotton clothing even in a cold country like \nTibet. \n10 Vital Heat, Dumo (T.T.: gTum.Mo.): the \"mystic\" heat produced from \nthe Navel Center in Tantric meditations. It is one of the most important practices \nof Tibetan Tantrism. See \"The Six Yogas of Naropa,\" in Evans-Wentz' \"Tibetan \nYoga and Secret Doctrines,\" 2nd ed., Oxford University Press, 1958. See also the \ntranslator's \"Teachings of Tibetan Yoga.\" \n11 The Four Ills: the sicknesses that are caused by the unbalancing strength \nand activity of the Four Elements- earth, water, fire, and air- in the yogi's body. \n12 The Practiced Succession (T.T.: sGrub.brCyud.): another name for Ghagyuba, the School of Marpa and Milarepa. The reason for this nomenclature is due \nto the spirit and tradition of this School which emphasizes Yoga practice and actual \nexperience, rather than scholastic investigation. This tradition differs sharply from \nthe traditions of the Yellow (Gelugba) and Gray (Sajyaba) Schools of Tibet. \n13 Nectar of Samaya: Samaya implies the Tantric precepts. He who observes \nthese precepts receives grace and blessings, a necessary nourishment for spiritual \ngrowth. \n14 This can also be rendered as: \"thoughts of a limitative pattern\" (T.T.: \nPhyogs.Chahi.rTog.Pa.). The patterns of thought of sentient beings are of a limited \nor finite nature. When one realizes the truth of Voidness (Siinyata), the limitative patterns of thought are fundamentally transformed. Using Buddhist terminology, they \"dissolve\" into the Dharmadhatu- the absolute, universal, and interpenetrating state of all the different aspects of existence in the light of the Void. \n15 Dharmakaya: the \"Body of Truth,\" which is ultimate, formless, omnipresent, and yet without any attributes. \n16 When a yogi is preparing to meditate over a long period, he will mark lines \non the ground around his dwelling, outside of which he will not go. In this case Milarepa did not have to make any marks, as the snow itself was deep and heavy \nenough to confine him.", "tokens": 951, "page_debut": null}

Here Tig \nLe implies the essence or immutability of Absolute Truth. \n20 Sphere of Experience: The yogi, in all activities of daily life, whether walk· \ning, eating, sleeping, talking, or the like, never loses the feeling or \"sensation,\" of \nhis yogic experience. \n21 The l\\'ac;lis (Roma and Junma): the mystical left and right Channels (see \nStory 1, Note 28). \n22 Bodhi-Mind (or Bodhi-Heart) here means Tig Le. \n23 Maya means delusion or illusion. The phenomenal world is considered by \nBuddhism to be a dream, a phantasm, a magic shadow play, a reflection- in short \nit has only an illusory existence and not a real one. \n24 Food of the Dead: The Tibetan Lamas believe that to accept offerings \nfrom relatives of the deceased person on his behalf incurs a great responsibility.

Among the meanings and applications of this term, two are most significant: first, the vow and action of liberating all sentient beings from suffering and \nbringing them to Buddhahood; and second, the direct realization of the Ultimate \nTruth.

Devas, men, and asuras live in the upper \nthree Lokas; animals, hungry ghosts, and denizens of hell, in the lower three. \n11 Habitual thoughts, (T.T.: Bag.Chags.; Skt.: Vasana): According to Mahayana Buddhism, especially Yogacara, sentient beings' consciousnesses are brought \ninto play by the force of habitual thoughts. Reason and affect are all made up of \nthe accumulated \"psychic contents\" that have been well-preserved in the Alaya or \nStore Consciousness. \n12 Suchness (T.T.: De.bShin.!\\lid; Skt.: Tathata), is also translated as \"Thatness,\" implying that Absolute Reality is essentially indescribable; it is as such all \nthe time. \n13 Heart-air: See Story 1, Note 17. \n14 Dharma-clinging (T.T.: Chos.hDsin.): According to Buddhism. there are two \nforms of clinging: (1) The Clinging-to-Ego (see Note 28), and (2) the Clingingto-Dhanna. The Clinging-to-Dharma implies an innate tendency to hold becomings \nand manifestations to be real and subsistent. The very conception of \"being,\" declares Mahayana Buddhism, is a product of the Clinging-to-Dharma. \n15 Self-awareness (T.T.: Ran.Rig.): the self-aware or self-witnessing faculty \nof the consciousness which is, according to Yogacara, the mind per se. The function \nof self-awareness is to be aware of the awareness itself; it is a pure awareness without \nany subject-content. To cultivate this pure awareness is the pinnacle practice of \nMahamudra. \n16 Distraction and drowsiness: These two hindrances are experienced by all \nwho practice meditation- the two major enemies of the yogi. \n17 The human mind is inclined either to cling to the \"View of existenceand-permanency\" (T.T.: rTag.ITa.), or to the \"View of annihiliation-and-non-existence\" (T.T.: Chad.ITa.). The former holds to the eternal existence of true being, \nand the latter to the ultimate annihiliation of all existence. The remedy for both \nof these extremes or \"wrong views\" is the Middle Way Doctrine upheld by Buddhism. \n18 Or, subjectivity and objectivity: All Saq1saric conceptions and emotions are \ncharacterized by a subjective-objective pattern- the knower and the known, the \nlover and the one loved, etc. This dualistic pattern of thought is the fundamental \ncause of Sa~T~sara. Enlightenment is but the transformation and emancipation from \nthe two grabping jaws of the pincers of dualism. \n19 See Story 2, Note 21. \n20 Joking words: Milarepa here alludes to his remarks in praise of the demoness Draug Srin Mo, made in the beginning of the first song, as merely ridicule. \n21 Buddha and the Five Demons: On the eve of His enlightenment, Guatama Buddha conquered the demons of the Five Desires who came to afflict Him. \n22 The stock, or accumulation of merits (T.T.: Tshogs.bSags.): another frequently used phrase in Buddhism.

This blessing power, or grace-wave, is considered to be one of the determining factors of a yogi's success in his devotion. The speed of his accomplishment \nis said to depend largely on the intensity and amount of the grace-waves that he is \ncapable of receiving from his Guru. \n35 Hinayana, meaning the Small Vehicle, denotes the original form of Buddhism that developed after Sakyamuni's death.

The purpose of this rigid practice is twofold: to renounce \nthe procurement of fur and the craving for it, and to train himself for doing without \nfurs in an extremely cold region such as Tibet, thus stimulating the production of \nmore inner heat. \n2 The Yogas (lit.: Instructions) of Invocation, Identification, and Transformation (T.T.: bSre.hPho.sKor.gSum.): In the Bardo plane (the intermediate stage \nbetween death and rebirth) the deceased sees numerous visions and images which \nare actually manifestations of his own mind. But, because of habitual-thinking \nand the Clinging-to-Ego, the uninitiated one cannot identify these visions and see \ninto their true nature. Tantric Yoga not only serves the purpose of enabling one to \nrealize the innate Buddhahood in this life, hut also is a preparation for the stage \nof Bardo. When a proficient yogi sees the various manifestations of the Bardo, he \ncan immediately identify the sound which he hears with the Mantra (or invocation) \nof his patron Buddha, and the images he sees with figures of the same. Through the \npractice of the Yogas of Invocation, Identification, and Transformation in this lifetime, the yogi is able to dispel the fear of Bardo. These three Yogas may be described \nas follows: \n(I) Invocation Yoga: By praying, and reciting the Mantra of a special \npatron Buddha, the yogi invokes the protection of that tutelary. \nIdentification Yoga: In Yoga practice, the yogi identifies or unites \nhimself with the tutelary. Thus in the stage of Bardo, when wrathful \n(2) \nand peaceful deities appear, the yogi may identify himself with them. \n(See W. Y. Evans-Wentz' \"Tibetan Book of the Dead,\" Oxford University Press, London, 19 57.) \n(3) Transformation Yoga: Through the practice of this Yoga the visions \nof the Bardo may be transformed at will. \nPra~a-Mina or Energy-Mind (T.T.: Rluit. Sems.): This is an important \nterm in Tantrism. It is said that a yogi who has mastered the Mind-energy, or Energymind, is capable of performing supernorn1al feats, one of them being to fly wherever he chooses. (See also Story 3, Note 2.) \noi A special Tibetan Yoga called \"gCod,\" devised for destroying one's Egoclinging. In practicing this Yoga, the yogi offers his own body to s\"t:ntient beings \nthrough special visualizations. \n5 Jaung Chub Tsong: The Castle of Bodhi (T.T.: Byait.Chub.rDson.). \n6 Samadhi of the Flowing River: This refers to a mental state experienced \nby the yogi in Mahamudra practice, in which he feels he is free from attachment to \nall phenomena. Although immersed in phenomenal existence, he is not affected by \nit; he encompasses the flux of things, he watches the flux of becoming flow by. \nThough he is aware of the identity of himself and the flux, he knows that he is the \nmaster, and enjoys a liberated spirit within the great flow.

(See Milarepa's Biography, \"Tibet's Great Yogi, Milarepa,\" 2nd ed., \nedited by W. Y.

The translator believes \nthat \"thrice animated the Bodhi-Mind\" signifies the complete unfoldment of the socalled three-fold Bodhi-Mind: (1) the Bodhisattva's Vow, (2) the Transcendental \nBodhi-Mind, or the Non-distinction Wisdom, and (3) the \"Occult\" Bodhi-Mind, \nthat is, according to Tantrism, the essence (semen), or the source-energy of the \nphysical body. \n16 Non-distinction of Means and Wisdom, or, rendered in a different way, the \nTwo-in-One Means-Wisdom: The Bodhisattva's activity includes two main facets, \n(1) the cultivation of Wisdom, i.e., the practice and realization of the PrajJiaparamita (Perfect Wisdom); and (2) the practice of Means or Virtue, i.e., the first \nfive Paramitas, namely, charity, discipline, patience, diligence, and meditation. Only advanced yogis are capable of realizing the Non-distinction or Non-differentiation of these two practices. \n17 \"Radiant\" denotes the self-radiant or self-illuminating nature of Mind; \"Valley of Remedy\" denotes the realization of the Self-mind as being the cure or remedy \nfor all evils. \n18 Arising Yoga (T.T.: sKyed.Rim.): In the Anuttara Tantra, the Supreme \nTantra, there are two major practices: one is the Arising Yoga, the other is the Perfecting Yoga. The former is the preparation for the latter- it places emphasis \non concentration and visualization exercises, and through them the Dhyana or Samadhi state is reached. Unless the yogi has reached a stage of advanced Dhyana \nor Samadhi, he is not capable of practicing the latter. \n19 Perfecting Yoga (T.T.: rDsogs.Rim.): the advanced Yoga of Tibetan Tantrism. It is a practice of uniting mind and Praf}a. (See W. Y. Evans-Wentz' \n\"Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines,\" 2nd ed., Oxford University Press, London, \n1958.) \n20 Two-in-One Suchness: This term may also be rendered as \"Non-dualistic \nSuchness.\" In the realm of Sarpsara, different views and interpretations on a thing \nare formed from different levels and positions. To the average person, a glass of \nwater is merely a means of quenching thirst; to a physicist. it is a combination of \nelements in motion; and to a philosopher, it is a series of relationships. These different views or understandings, arising from different levels and realms of thinking, \nare thus the distinctive characteristic of Sarpsaric thought, whereas in the Two-inOne or Many-in-One State, these different views do not exist as such. \n21 The Three Worlds, or the Three Realms (T.T.: Khams.gSum.): According \nto Buddhism, these are the World of Desire, the World of Form, and the World of \nNon-form.

He also prophesied as to those places wherein Milarepa should \npractice meditation. \n3 The one who practices Mahamudra should know that, from the ultimate \nviewpoint, Saq1sara is Nirvana, evil is good, Kle~as are Bodhi. The up-and-down \nfeelings, or the vici~situdinous emotions occurring in meditation, do not in their \nultimate sense differ from Mind-Essence. To an advanced yogi, the greater the \nKle~as that arise in his mind, the brighter, deeper, and better his illumination as to \nReality. \n4 According to Tantrism the Guru is even more important than Buddha. To \nbe blessed by one's Guru is of the utmost importance. According to Tibetan tradition, in the beginning of any type of meditation, the yogi always visualizes the Guru \nsitting above his head, and prays to him. \n5 Here Milarepa implies the teaching of advanced Tantrism. \n6 The Five Poisonous Passions or Desires (the Five Kle~as) are lust, hate, \nblindness, pride, and jealousy. \n7 Path with Form: the Arising Yoga and the Perfecting Yoga of Tantrism \n(see the translator's comments in the Appendix, and Story 5, Notes 18 and 19). \n8 Whispered Transmission (T.T.: sJ'Ian.brGyud.): (I) We are told that in \nolden days the hidden teachings of Tantra were given to the disciples in a most \nsecret manner, i.e., through whispering; (2) this term is used as another name for \nthe Ghagyuba School, the School of Marpa and Milarepa. \n9 Experience (T.T.: J'lams.) and Reali1.ation (T.T.: rTogs.): These two words, \nJ'lams. and rTogs., are difficult to translate into adequate English. J'lams is the indirect, incomplete, imperfect, and \"half-opaque\" experience and understanding that \nthe yogi attains in meditation; while rTogs (Realization) is the direct, complete, \nclear, and perfect experience. The former is similar to Enlightenment, while the latter is the real Enlightenment. J'lams is like the experience of a traveler approaching a city who sees the city as a whole, but has not yet reached it; nevertheless, \nhe gets an over-all picture and impression. However, Realization (rTogs.) of the \ncity comes when he is in the city and knows what it really is at first hand. \nI 0 This means, \"Do not unscrupulously take the offerings of the relatives of \na deceased person.\" \n11 \"Accumulation of Merits\" (T.T.: Tshogs.bSags.) is a frequently used Buddhist term that can be explained in a variety of ways. Generally it means all the virtuous and spiritual practices. Specifically, in Mahayana Buddhism, it denotes the \nfirst five Paramit1is of the Bodhisattva, i.e., charity, discipline, patience, diligence, \nand meditation. See Story 9, Note 8. \n12 Corresponding and actual Realization (T.T.: J'lams.rTogs.): Realization \nor Englightenment brought about in meditation usually follows a sequence: the \ncorresponding, or resembling Realization comes first; the actual Realization follows: \nSee Note 9. \n13 Mothers: Here this term seems to imply the Mother-Divinities such as \nTara, Dorje Paumo, Lhamo, and others. \n14 Ma~c;lala, in this case, signifies a Tantric utensil for sacramental offerings.", "tokens": 843, "page_debut": null}

[and] Thig.Le.): The Path-withForm of Tantrism emphasizes the physical practice as well as the mental practice. In order to build up a favorable condition in which the realization of transcendental Truth may easily be achieved, Tantrism provides exercises to purify the \nnervous, breathing, and excretory systems. \n20 \"Ups-and-downs\" here signifies the fluctuating actions and emotions in daily activity. \n21 To those who have not reached the state of the Perfect Mutual-containing, or the Non-discriminating Whole, the antithetical aspect of being, which originates from dualistic ideas, becomes the paramount obstacle that debars them from \nrealizing the non-differentiated Totality. Also, it produces a belief in the incompatibility of opposites, i.e., of being and non-being, existence and non-existence, etc.-\nin this case, Voidness and moral values. In certain aspects, the yogi who realizes the \nteaching of Voidness should not even see the existence of good and evil in his practice. \n22 Cotton-clad (T.T.: Ras.Pa.): The yogi who is able to produce bodily heat \nthrough Yoga, thus wearing only cotton clothes in severe cold weather, is called \nRepa (Ras.Pa.). \n23 This house is, of course, symbolic; but Milarepa did build many houses for \nMarpa before he was accepted by him. \n24 Ah Shea (T.T.: A.c;:ad.) Vital Heat: the heat produced in Tantric meditation. See \"The Six Yogas of Naropa,\" in \"Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines,\" \nedited by W_ Y. Evans-\\Ventz. \n2 5 The Seven Holy Jewels are: gold, silver, crystal, ruby, coral, agate, and \ncarnelian. Here Milarepa spoke of them in a figurative sense. \n26 The text is not clear here. The translator presumes that it implies the voluntary springing forth of secretion through self-suggestion, by the yogic power. \n27 Perpetual Sunyata: the eternal Voidness. \n28 Path of Two-in-One (T.T.: Lam.Zun.hJug.): A very widely used phrase in \nTibetan Buddhism_ It means the unification of antitheses, the joining of opposing \nforces, the merging of differentiations, and the like. \n29 Patron Buddha (T.T.: Yi.Dam.): Every Tantric yogi has a chosen patron \nBuddha, who is his protector, to whom he prays, and upon whom he relies.", "tokens": 873, "page_debut": null}

It is therefore called the Stage of One-Taste (the Realm of Universal To· \ntality, or the Realm of the Identity of Saq1sara and NirviiJ;Ja). However, this expe· \nrienee should by no means be regarded as a realization of any foiTJ;~ of monism -a \nmajor \"false view,\" that has been refuted by many Buddhist scholars, notably those \nof the Madhyamika SchooL (See Story 18, Note 9.) \nIn the fourth stage the meditator has already reached the Ultimate Realm. He \nhas nothing more to look for or to learn: he has reached the State of Buddhahood. \nThese four stages represent the complete process through which a Buddhist yogi \nproceeds to Ultimate Enlightenment. \n2 Playwords: All Saq1saric conceptions and ideas which have to be expressed \nthrough words and symbols are meaningless sophistries from the viewpoint of an en· \nlightened being. The tem1 \"Playwords\" (T.T.: sPros.Pa.) also implies that all Saq1· \nsa ric conceptualizations and verbalizations are on a par with children's prattlelittle more than nonsense. Realization of this is· considered the initial stage of Enlightenment. \n3 Three Bodies: the Trikaya, or Three Bodies of Buddha, i.e., the Dharmakaya, the Sambhogakaya, and the NirmaJ;Jakiiya. \n4 The human body is considered to be a precious possession, without which \nno spiritual development is possible. \n5 This sentence is extremely important as representing the essence of the \nteaching of Mahamudra. In general Buddhism one is taught to search for Enlight· \nenment and to attain Buddhahood, while in Mahamudra the Guru points out to the \ndisciple that one's own mind is Buddha Himself. and therefore, to search for any· \nthing, even Buddhahood, is a waste of time. \n6 This refers to the trials imposed on Milarepa by his Guru, Marpa, before he \nwas accepted for initiation. (See Milarepa's Biography, edited by W. Y. Evans· \nWentz.) \n7 Meaningful deeds: the virtuous deeds that lead one to Enlightenment. \n8 \"Amass merits\": This phrase is often used by Buddhists to denote all vir· \ntuous deeds. (See Story 4, Note 22; and Story 7, Note II.) \n9 Five Poisons: the Five Kle~as, the basic causes of all miseries of Samsara. \nThey are lust, hate, blindness, pride, and envy. \n· \n10 Lit.: Six Groups: a general term denoting the six outer objects, six organs, \nand six senses.", "tokens": 860, "page_debut": null}

It reads: \"I take refuge in the Buddha, I take refuge in the \nDharma, I take refuge in the Sangha.\" \n5, 6, 7 Foundation, Path, and Accomplishment (T.T.: gShi, Lam, hBres.Bu.): \nThese three terms are frequently used in Buddhist Tantric texts. They have various \nmeanings and uses. Generally speaking, the \"Foundation\" (gShi.) implies the basic \nprinciples of Buddhism; the \"Path\" (Lam.) is the practice, or way of action which \nis in conformity with the principles of the \"Foundation\"; and the \"Accomplishment\" (hBres.Bu.), otherwise translated as \"Fruit,\" is the full realization of the \nprinciples of the Foundation. For example, the Foundation of the teaching of \nMahamudra is the view that the innate Buddha-nature is within all sentient beings, \nwithout which no sentient being could possibly become Buddha regardless of how \nhard he attempted to practice the Dharma. \"Foundation\" is, therefore, the cause, \nthe seed, the potentiality, or the original innate Suchness that exists in all beings at \nall times. The Path of Mahamudra is the practice that one follows within the \nframework of the basic Mahamudra Doctrine. The Accomplishment of Mahamudra is the full realization of the original, endowed Buddha-nature- the Foundation \n-within oneself. These three terms, in addition to their special and specific connotations, are used here, as well as in many other places throughout the book, in \na very general sense to denote religious faith, practice, and achievement. \n8 A merit-possessor is a good vessel for Dharma, a well-destined person. According to Buddhism, a person becomes a good vessel for Dharma in this life partly \nbecause he has performed meritorious deeds in his past lives. \n9 Non-ego of existence (T.T.: Chos.Kyi.bDag.Med.): the truth of Non-being or \nVoidness. \nI 0 The Precepts of Five Virtues: These are the basic precepts for all Buddhists, including monks and laymen. They are: One should not (I) kill, (2) steal, \n(3) commit adultery, (4) lie, or (5) take intoxicants. \n11 Innate-hom Wisdom: From the Tantric viewpoint, the realization of this \ninborn and ubiquitous Wisdom is the realization of Buddhahood itself, and so is the \ncore of Tantric teachings. \n12 At the time of death, the Clear Light of the Dharmakaya will shine for a \nshort while, but because of ignorance and habitual clinging men cannot recognize it, \nthus they miss the chance of Liberation. See \"The Tibetan Book of the Dead,\" edited by W. Y. Evans-Wentz, Oxford University Press, 1957. \n13 Milarepa gave this very important warning to yogis, pointing out that there \nare many different kinds and degrees of illumination. Some are mundane, some \nare transcendental, some are psychic phenomena, and some are the real illuminations of Transcendental Wisdom. \n14 Mother-and-Son Light: See Story 9, Note 17. \n15 Buddhism claims that faith and meditation alone cannot liberate one \nfrolll Satpsara. Without the complete destruction of ego-clinging, or the absolute \nannihilation of the habitual-thinking seeds in the Store Consciousness (Alayavijfiana), a real Liberation is impossible. Various teachings are given by different \nBuddhist Schools to attain this Liberation, such as the Prajfiaparamita of Madhyamika; the Contemplation-on-Away-from-Subjective-Objective-Ideas of Yogacara; the \nSameness of Satpsiira and Nirva~a of general Tantrism; and the Unification of the \nMother-and-Son Light of Mahamudra. \n16 Faith, good will, compassion, and Samadhi cannot bring one to Enlightenment without the Prajfia insight. Deep contemplation on Siinyata, or Voidness, is \ntherefore absolutely necessary.", "tokens": 931, "page_debut": null}

He used all his strength, struggling \nwith distended eyes to lift the rock, but he could not move it an inch. \nSeeing this, Milarepa said, \"I am a yogi who has attained both the Common and Ultimate Accomplishments. My miraculous powers are different from yours. Though you have achieved the miraculous power of the \nCommon Accomplishment, it can never emulate mine.

But what a pity that you Bon priests think your little bit of mystical \ninner experience is the Ultimate Accomplishment! To attain the Ultimate Accomplishment one has to behold the nature of his own mind. \nIf one wants to realize this, he should follow and meditate on the teachings of my School -\nthe Practice Succession.\" The Bon priest replied; \n\"What difference is there between your mind and mine?

Therefore, so far, it looks as if you are superior. Anway, the race to Di Se will settle everything once and for all.\" \nMilarepa replied, \"All right! Very good!

When the disciples looked at the priest again, they found that despite all his efforts \nto mount higher, he could only circle round and round the mountain. \nWhen the day broke, and the sun appeared, Milarepa snapped his \nfingers, donned a cloak for wings, and flew over toward Di Se.

One is known as the \"Expedient Teaching\" (T.T.: Dran.Don.), and the other, as the \"Ultimate,\" or \"Final \nTeaching\" (T.T.: Nes.Don.). The \"Expedient Teachings\" are those doctrines arranged and preached for the unevolved or not-yet-ripened devotees who are not \nready to receive the higher form of teaching. The \"Final Teachings\" are those \nwhich may be described as supreme and ultimate. \nThe myriads of Buddhas see only one final Reality in the realm of Supreme \nEnlightenment. However, to enable all sentient beings to realize this Reality, various approaches, teachings, or steps appropriate to different groups and individuals \nare necessary because all sentient beings do not share the same dispositions, capacities, and Karmas. A teaching that is beneficial to one group or to one individual \nmay not be helpful to another; hence, a variety of approaches is needed to ripen \nthese innumerable types of people. For the Hinayana-bent, Hinayana Buddhism is \ntaught; for the Mahayana-bent, Mahayana Buddhism. This approach is also true for \nChristians, Hindus, and other religionists- an appropriate teaching, even in the \nguise of a different faith, is wisely given to all and sundry who may require it. \nBecause of this all-embracing attitude, Mahayana Buddhism is impregnated \nwith an extremely inclusive and tolerant spirit, which has been unmistakably \ndemonstrated throughout Buddhist history. This recognition of the value and usefulness of all religions is typically reflected in the popular Buddhist proverb, \"Since \nsentient beings suffer many different sicknesses, Buddha, the King of Physicians, \nhas to prescribe for them various treatments and medicines; hence all the teachings \nof the different Schools and religions arc merely the differing remedies prescribed \nby Him for the benefit of each case.\" \nAlthough the Expedient Teachings are necessary for those who have not evolved \nto a level advanced enough to accept the highest teachings (the Final Truth), they \ndo lay a foundation for approaching it; without these Expedient Teachings, it \nwould not be possible for many who, for the time being, do not yet possess the capacity, to appreciate and practice the higher teachings. \n3 Mind-holding Practice: Most of the meditation practices are devised for \nthe development of mental concentration, i.e., to hold onto an object in one's \nmind's-eye. In other words, a mental effort is required in all of them. But the meditation of Mahamudra is of a quite different nature. It is effortless and natural; in its \npractice no object whatsoever is held in the yogi's mind. In comparison with the \nteaching of Mahamudra, all others are temporal and expedient. \n4 The White Element is the positive, and the Red Element the negative force \nof the body. \n5 Body of Illusion: Any body possessing form and attributes is illusory; this \napplies to both Sal]lsaric and NirvaJ;tiC bodies, including the Reward Body and \nTransformation Body of Buddha. \n6 Bardo here does not mean the state after death, it means \"in-between\" \nstates of all kinds.", "tokens": 825, "page_debut": null}

The consummation of this bliss is achieved when the lifeenergy reaches the Cakra at the top of the head. \n2 It is said that when a Tantric yogi reaches a very advanced stage of Enlightenment, he should practice the Tantric Madness or Act-of-Insanity by behaving \nlike a lunatic, to completely emancipate himself from all conventional thoughts \nand habits and thus reach final and perfect Enlightenment. \n3 Lit.: The Sa111adhi of \"Elements-Exhaustion\" (T.T.: Zad.Pa.hByun.Bahi.Tiil. \nI'le.hDsin.): Having completely mastered the art of Dhyana, the yogi is said to be \ncapable of working mirades by manipulating the Pra~a in various ways within his \nmind·body complex. He is thus able to conceal or bring into manifestation the power \nof each Element for a specific performance or purpose. \n4 Ba Men, the wild ox of Tibet: Some say this is another name for the Tibetan \nyak. \n5 T.T.: Bar.dHa.Na.: This seems to be another geographical name for Tibet. \n6 The Tibetan word, \"sPyan.Phyag,\" means literally \"eye obeisance.\" The \ntranslator presumes that this term refers to a certain eye·gesture (mudra) performed for the purpose of veneration. This may still be used in India, but is no \nlonger extant in Tibet. \n7 Yed Pa (T.T.: bShad.Pa.): Milarepa was given the name of Yed Pa \nDorje (the Laughing Vajra) by his Guru, Marpa, when he was first initiated. \n8 Worldly Qakinis (T.T.: hJin.rTen.mKha.hCro.Ma.): Khandroma, or Qakinis, the sky travelers, are not all more holy than, or spiritually superior to, ordinary \nsentient beings. According to traditional Tibetan beliefs, there are two kinds of !;>akinis: one is the holy, or transcendental type, and the other is the worldly kind. \nTara, Dorje Paumo, etc., belong to the former category, for they are fully enlightened Buddhas manifesting in female form. The worldly Qakinis, such as Tserinma, \nare still bound by Sa111saric desires and ignorance despite their superhuman powers. \n9 Lit.: \" ... at the upper end of my three Na4is.\" \n10 A while: ago: See Story 28. \n11 Worldly, or mundane accomplishments: miraculous performances and superhuman powers which are still of a Sa111saric nature. \n12 Passion·Bodhis (T.T.: hDod.Bahi.Byan.Chub.): This is a very rare term \nseldom seen in the general Buddhist scriptures. Literally it means the \"Bodhi of \nKlesas.\" Although, according to the principle of Tantrism, it is permissible to say \nthat human passions and desires (Klrsas) are in essence identical with the merits \nand wisdom of Buddhahood, it is incorrect to say that the two are absolutely identical in every aspect. Passion·Bodhis, or the Bodhi of Klesas, should therefore be \ntreated as an exceptional term reflecting a certain special Tantric thought outside \nthe general framework of Buddhist orthodoxy. \n13 This sentence as it appeared in the Tibetan text (Folio 151a, line 6) is as \nfollows: \"bCegs.Pas.Sans.rCyas.J\\Iid.Kyan.Med.\" The translator believes that \"bCegs. \nPas.,\" meaning ''because of hindrances,\" is a misprint, otherwise it would be very \ndifficult to explain, and to fit into this context. \n14 T.T.: Ro.gCid., lit.: \"one-taste.\" A freer tramlation is \"at-one-ment,\" or \"the \ngreat one identity.\" \"Ro.gCid.\" is a very widely used term in Tantric literature, denoting the all-identical or non-differentiated nature of beings. \n15 Two Truths: They are, first, the Mundane Truth (T.T.: Kun.rDsob.bDen. \nPa.), and second, the Transcendental Truth (T.T.: Don.Dam.bDen.Pa.). The \nformer can also be rendered as the \"conditional, dependent, or expedient Truth,\" \nand the latter as the \"absolute or final Truth.\"", "tokens": 980, "page_debut": null}

See Story 29, Note 8. \n7 Dormas (T.T.: gTor.l\\.Ia.): In making the various oblations for Tantric rituals, Tibetan lamas have developed a highly sophisticated art of making these oblation objects from baked flour dough.

Dorjc-Chang is the source \nand center of all the other five. Chronologically He is the First Buddha. The socalled Sixth Buddha is, therefore, a very misleading term created because of the \nOriental habit of counting in the direction starting from the East. \n13 Action of F.qnality (T.T.: Ro.si\\loms.Kyi.~:Pyod.Pa.): 'When a yogi reaches \nthe advanced stage he is able to \"equalize\" fear and hope, joy and pain, evil and virtue, etc. I le is then no more affected by polarity, and begins to equalize and unify \nthe opposing forces as manifested in dualism. \n14 The Four Dhyanas: These denote the Four Formless Dhyanas, i.e., the \nDhyanas of Infinite Space, of Infinite Consciousness, of Nothingness, and of Neither Consciousness nor Non-ConsciOusness. \n15 Body-of-Essence (T.T.: i\\lo.\\Vo.i\\lid.Kyi.sKu.): The complete name for this \nterm should be \"Body of the Universal Essence\" (T.T.: Chos.d\\Vyiii.J\\Io.Wo.J\\Iid. \nKyi.sKu.), which is the unity, or the indivisible aspect of the Trikaya.

But th1s locution is rather unusual, and lacks sufficient -reason. \"It is acceptable in Mahayana Buddhism to say that there is a Pure Land of the \nSambhogakaya or a Land of the Nirma~akaya, but it would be difficult to accept \nthe idea of a Land of the Dharmakaya, which is formless and void.

Bardo. \n28 Dri.Za.: the Smell Eater. It is said that most of the spirits, or metamorphosis-born beings, are fed on odors. This is true of Devas, Asuras, and ghosts. \n29 The Thirteenth Stage: Generally, Mahayanists accept only ten progressive \nenlightenment stages of a Bodhisattva, known as the Ten Bhiimis; passing the tenth \nstage, Buddhahood is then reached. Therefore, Buddhahood is considered as the \neleventh stage. But according to some Tantrists, the Supreme Vajra-Buddhahood is \nstill two steps beyond the general eleventh stage. Thus, the stage of Dorje-Chang is \nconsidered as the Thirteenth Stage- a very controversial topic in Tantric Buddhism. \n30 The Illuminating Light-of-the-Path (T.T.: Lam.Gyi.Hod.Zer.): This is the \nWisdom-Light a yogi sees on the Path (or during his meditation practice). Altogether there are three kinds of \"Lights\": (1) The Light of Origin, or the Mother \nLight (T.T.: Mahi.Hod.Zer.); (2) The Light of the Path, or the Light of the Son \n(T.T.: Lam.Gyi.Hod.Zer.); and (3) The Light of Fruit, or the Light of Union \n(T.T.: hBras.Buhi.Hod.Zer.). \n31 The Third Initiation: Third Initiation is also called the Wisdom Initiation (T.T.: Ye.<;es.Kyi.dWan.) During this initiation the disciple is shown the \ntruth of the unity of bliss and voidness by the symbol of sexual union. \n32 Toagal (T.T.: Thod.rGal.): This is the advanced teaching of the Great \nPerfection of the Ningmaba School, which is quite different .and unique in comparison with the Yogic teachings of the New Schools of Tibetan Tantrism.

However, his heart-son, Rechungpa, was not satisfied with \nthis victory, for he thought that the Jetsun had not answered the \nmonk's questions in a scholarly manner. \"The only way,\" Rechungpa \nthought to himself, \"to conquer these scholars, who cannot even be \nconvinced by the evidence of miracles, is through logic and argument, \nor by black magic and curses. I might ask the Jetsun to teach me \nblack magic, but it is not likely that he would. Oh, confound it! These \ndamned scholars who belittle genuine miracles as sorceries!

Well, \nit is true that my Guru is well-versed in the Pith-Instructions for attaining Buddhahood in one life, but in order to beat these scholars, \nI shall go to India to learn logic and science.\" He then went to Milarepa and told him of his intention. The Jetsun said, \"Rechungpa, if \nwe had been defeated in the debate, how could the scholars have \ncredited us with pure [thoughts]? If you go to India merely for the \npurpose of learning the art of debate, you are then doing something \nwrong and worthless. [That also means that you will] forsake meditation practice. In learning 'semantics,' you may acquire some knowledge about words, but still you will not be able to win all the debates, \nnor can you master the whole study of letters. Only Buddha can answer all questions and challenges, but to achieve Buddhahood one must \npractice. Therefore, the best way is to abjure the world, renounce all \nthoughts and wishes of this life, and devote oneself to meditation.

His father, a physician called Wutso Gabar Jalbo, had two wives, Yunlaza and Sangdan Dranma, each of \nwhom gave birth to a son. Gambopa was the eldest, and was called \nDunba Dharmadraug. His father, being an excellent consultant in \nworldly affairs, trained him well so that he became proficient in speech \nand in consultation. When Gambopa was fifteen he had already \nlearned many Tantric teachings of the Ningmaba, such as the Basic \nTantra of Sungwa Nyinbo, Heruka Galbo, the Tantras of the Wrathful and Peaceful Buddhas and of the Great Merciful Net-Holder, and \nmany other teachings of the Old School. He had also mastered the \neight branches of medical science taught by his father. \nAt twenty-two he married the sister of the powerful [local] chieftain, Dharma Aui. She had all the admirable qualities of a lady. They \nhad a son and daughter, but [a pestilence broke out in that area, \nand] the son died. Gambopa accompanied the corpse to the cemetery, and when he returned home, found that his daughter had also \ndied. A few days later his wife caught the same disease. Every kind \nof medical treatment was tried, and prayers were repeated and sacraments held, but in vain. \nAfter suffering great pain for a long time, she was still trying desperately to hold on to life.

This must be due to her extreme attachmept to something.\" \nHe then said to her, \"Those who do not understand the true nature of Saqtsara are toilworn and overburdened; those who are compelled to linger in Sarpsara are miserable and pitiful.

Our patrons also need a spiritual leader to increase their merits. Whom do you think can assume this responsibility? Whoever you have in mind should be given all the Pith-Instructions without reservation, and should be invested with power and status. Without such a man, neither our teachings nor our Lineage can \nspread widely, nor can our disciples be properly guided.\" Hearing \ntheir request, the Jetsun at first appeared slightly displeased. Then he \nreplied, \"Yes, indeed I shall have a good disciple, who will develop \nmy teachings immensely. I shall, this evening, observe where he is \nand [will tell you] if you return early tomorrow morning.\" \nThe next morning, Milarepa arose earlier than usual, summoned \nall his disciples and patrons, and said: \n\"Like a Dharma-replenished vessel, the man who will receive my \nPith-Instructions in full will soon come.

I will show you the way.\" \nLater [Gambopa] realized that all three paupers were Milarepa's \ntransformations. \nGambopa continued his journey, asking for directions along the way. \nWhen he reached Dronso Charwa, he met a number of tradesmen \nfrom the highlands and asked them about Milarepa. A merchant from \nNya Non called Dawazungpo said, \"The master of Yoga, the great \nMilarepa, the accomplished Guru whose fame is known all over Tibet, \nis now residing at Chu Bar of Orin.\" Hearing this, Gambopa became so excited that he thought the merchant was Milarepa Himself. In wild confusion he hugged the man and burst into tears. \nWith the newly acquired information, Gambopa now went towards \nDin Ri. When he -reached the center of a big plain he became exhausted, and sat down to rest on a rock.

He was desperately thirsty, but there was no one to \nbring him water. He remained there without food and water for \ntwo days and nights.

Then, accompanied \nby the monk, he resumed his journey. \nMeanwhile, the Jetsun, in a very happy mood, was preaching the \nDharma at Fortune Hill.

After Milarepa had done so, Rechungpa yearned to go to \nCentral Tibet [Weu]. \nAt that time some patrons said, \"Compare the father [Milarepa] \nwith the son [Rechungpa]; the son seems to be far superior because \nhe has been in India.\" Then the younger people all went to Rechungpa, while the older ones came to the Jetsun. One day many patrons \narrived. They brought Rechungpa fine and bountiful food, but gave \nMilarepa only meager offerings. [Not knowing this], Rechungpa \nthought, \"Since they have brought me such good food, they must have \nmade even better offerings to the Jetsun.\" He went to Milarepa and \nsaid, \"Dear Jetsun, haven't we received fine offerings today? With all \nthis food we can hold a sacramental feast with all the Repas. Shall we \ndo so?\" \n\"Very well,\" replied Milarepa, \"you will find my share under that \nslab of stone. Take and use·it.\" But Rechungpa found only a portion \nof rotten meat, a bottle of sour beer, and a small quantity of barley \nflour. On his way back, Rechungpa thought, \"Is this fitting of those \npatrons? Compared with my Buddha-like Guru, I am nothing. I cannot match a single hair of his head, even with my whole body. But \nnow these ignorant patrons are doing this foolish thing. Hitherto I \nhave been living with my Guru and receiving all the Instructions from \nhim. My intention was to go on living with him so that I could serve \nand please him. But as things stand now, if I stay with him too long", "tokens": 483, "page_debut": null}

The first group of stories are those of Milarepa's conquering and \nconversion of the malignant demons- Stories 1 through 8; the second group are \nthose of Milarepa and his well·endowed disciples- Stories 9 through 44; and the \nthird group are those of various categories- Stories 45 through 61.

The lama then sent him \nto the famous Guru- Marpa the Translator- who had just returned \nfrom India after many years of study and practice there. \nThe day before Milarepa arrived, both Marpa and his wife dreamed \nof goddesses who prophesied the coming of a disciple who would one \nday become the greatest teacher of Tibet, bringing salvation to in· \nnumerable sentient beings, bestowing Enlightenment upon countless \nDharma devotees, and glorifying the immaculate doctrine of Buddhism. \nPerceiving Milarepa's past sins and his great potential capacities, \nand wishing to clear away all hindrances that might otherwise block \nhis spiritual growth, Marpa relentlessly put him on trial by imposing \nupon him severe mental and physical penances. Milarepa was ordered \nto build, single-handed, one house after another on a desolate mountain, then to tear them down again for no apparent reason. In return \nfor long years of service, devotion, and obedience to Marpa, Milarepa \nreceived only humiliation and unjustified harsh treatment. At last he \nwas accepted as a disciple, and rewarded with the longed-for instructions. Then, for eleven continuous months, he meditated alone in a \ncave, where he finally attained direct Realization and an initial achievement on the Path to Bodhi. \nBy this time, Milarepa had been separated from his family for many \nyears. One day, while meditating in the cave, he fell asleep and \ndreamed that he returned home and saw the bones of his mother lying \nin the ruins of his house. He then thought that she must have died \nduring his long absence. He saw his only sister as a vagabond beggar, \nhis house and fields deserted and overgrown with a tangle of rank \nweeds. He awoke weeping bitterly, calling the names of his mother and \nsister, his pillow wet with tears. \n· \nStricken with grief and longing to see his mother, he left Marpa and \nwent back to his home village, where all the premonitions of his \ndream were confirmed.

As a consequence of this consistent effort, he \nfinaliy earned his reward- the realization of Ultimate Enlightenement. \nAfter this, his fame gradually spread over the whole of Tibet and Nepal. In his later years he was called by all Tibetans, \"Jetsun Milarepa\" \n(\"Holy Milarepa\"), and is regarded to this day as indisputably the \ngreatest poet, yogi, and saint in Tibetan history. \nMilarepa had a fine voice, and loved to sing. Even when he was a boy, \nhe was regarded by his countrymen as an excellent singer of folksongs. Sainthood and Enlightenment only made him sing more frequently and joyfully than before. When his patrons and disciples made \na request, or put a question to him, or a dispute arose, he answered \nthem not in dull prose but in freely flowing poems or lyric songs \ncomposed spontaneously. No one knows how many songs or \"poems\" \nhe \"composed\" in his lifetime. Tibetans believe there were close to \none hundred thousand.

Also, differing from those pedantic scholars and dogmatic \nTantric yogis who either adhered to ideas and words or to rites and \nforms, Milarepa cast away all erudite Buddhist studies and cumberso~e Tantric rituals, and marched directly toward Buddhahood by \nway of simple understanding and persistent practice. As a result, his \nteachings were also more precise, direct, and simple than those of conventional Tantrism, and well deserve being called the quintessential \nteqchings of practical Buddhism. Though Milarepa was ridiculed by a \nnumber of jealous scholars of his time as being an ignorant hermit who \nknew nothing about Buddhism, history has proved that his teachings \nwere far superior and more influential than those of any learned Budhist scholar of his day. \nThrough the illustration of his own life, Milarepa set for all Budhists an example of the perfect Bodhisattva, and a model of the incorruptible life of a genuine practitioner of Buddhist Tantrism. His life \nis an unmistakable testimony to the unity and interdependency of all \nBuddhist teachings- Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana- for Buddahood is not attainable if any of the three are lacking. He made it \nclear to all that poverty is not a kind of deprivation, but rather a \nnecessary way of emanicpating oneself from the tyranny of material \npossessions; that Tantric practice by no means implies indulgence and \nlaxity, but hard labor, strict discipline, and steadfast perseverance; that \nwithout resolute renunciation and uncompromising discipline, as Guatama Buddha Himself stressed, all the sublime ideas and dazzling images depicted in Mahayana and Tantric Buddhism are no better than \nmagnificent illusions. \nMilarepa was one of the very few Buddhist saints whose transmitted \nteachings have given birth to more enlightened beings than have any \nof the Mahayana Buddhist Schools, except Ch'an Buddhism in China. \nHui Neng, the founder of Ch'an, was perhaps the only figure in \nBuddhist history whose influence and contribution can, in various aspects, rival those of Milarepa. \nThese two great sages also had many other things in common. They \nboth laid stress on actual practice and direct Realization, and in both \ninstances their teachings were characterized by extreme simplicity and \nstraightforwardness. But the teaching of Milarepa seems to be more \nthorough, complete, and \"advanced\" than that of Hui Neng because, \nunlike Hui Neng, who put all his emphasis on the Prajiiaparamita, Milarepa accentuated all the essential teachings of Buddhism. In stressing \nthe importance of the Dharmakaya, both are alike; but as to the teaching of the other two Kayas - the manifestation, and the dynamic force \nof Buddhahood - Milarepa's seems to be the more thorough.

In \norclh to help those who may not have had such a background, a brief \nsummary of the essential teachings of Tibetan Tantrism is given \nin the following pages. Information on general Buddhism is not included, since this may be obtained from sources easily available to all. \nIt goes without saying that this brief summary is less than adequate to \nrepresent the vast and comprehensive contents of the Tibetan Tantra. \nOne cannot expect, therefore, to glean from these brief lines more \nthan a hint of the essential, underlying principles. \nTibetan Tantrism is a form of practical Buddhism abounding in \nmethods and techniques for carrying out the practice of all the Ma* \nhayana teachings. In contrast to the \"theoretical\" forms of Buddhism, \nsuch as Sautrantika, Vaibha~ika, Madhayamika, Yogacara, Hua Yen, \nTien Tai, etc., Buddhist Tantrism lays most of its stress on practice \nand Realization, rather than on philosophical speculations. Its central \nprinciples and practices may be summarized as follows: \n1. That all existence and manifestation can be found in one's experience, that this experience is within one's own mind, and that Mind \nis the source and creator of all things. \n2. That Mind is an infinitely vast, unfathomably deep complex of \nmarvels, its immensity and depth being inaccessible to the uninitiated. \n3. That he who has come to a thorough realization and perfect mastership of his own mind is a Buddha, and that those who have not \ndone so are unenlightened sentient beings.", "tokens": 592, "page_debut": null}

That the consciousness of sentient beings is of limited awareness; \nthe consciousness of an advanced yogi, of illuminating awareness; the \nconsciousness of an enlightened Bodhisattva, of illuminating-void \nawareness; and the \"consciousness\" of Buddha, the GREAT ILLU-\n.

Each of these \ndualities, though apparently antithetical, is an inseparable unity. The \ndual forces that we see about us are, in fact, one \"entity\" manifesting in two different forms or stages. Hence, if one's consciousness or \nmind is disciplined, tamed, transformed, extended, sharpened, illuminated, and sublimated, so will be his Pral)as, and vice versa. The practice that stresses taming the Pral).a is called the \"Yoga with Form,\" \nor the \"Path of Means.\" The practice that stresses taming the mind \nis called the \"Yoga without Form,\" or the \"Path of Liberation.\" The \nformer is an exertive type of Yoga practice, and the latter a natural \nand effortless one, known as Mahamudra.4", "tokens": 610, "page_debut": null}

It is a \nnatural and spontaneous practice, bypassing many preparations, strenuous exercises, and even successive stages as laid down in other types of \nYoga. Its essence consists in the Guru's capability of bringing to hi~ \ndisciple a glimpse of the Innate Buddha-Mind in its primordial and \nnatural state. With this initial and direct \"glimpsing experience,\" the \ndisciple gradually learns to sustain, expand, and deepen his realization \nof this Innate Mind. Eventually he will consummate this realization \nto its full blossoming in Perfect Enlightenment. This practice is called \nMahamudra. \n(A) The first glimps of the Innate Mind can be acquired either \nthrough practicing Mahamudra Yoga by oneself, or through receiving a \"Pointing-out\" demonstration from one's Guru. The former \nway is to follow the Guru's instructions and meditate alone; the \nlatter consists of an effort by the Guru to open the disciple's mind \ninstantaneously. Both approaches, however, require the continuous \npractice of Mahamudra Yoga to deepen and perfect one's experience. \n(B) The central teaching of Mahamudra consists of two, major \npoints: relaxation, and effortlessness.

The primary concern of \nMahamudra, therefore, is to instruct the yogi on how to relax the \nmind and thus induce in him the unfolding of his Primordial Mind. \nParadoxically, effortlessness is even more difficult to achieve than \nrelaxation. It requires long practice to become \"effortless\" at all \ntimes and under all circumstances.

Translations of several sections, however, have been available for some \ntime. Many thoughtful and interested readers may be curious as to \nwhy an important work such as this has never been fully translated. \nThere are many reasons for this. In addition to the depth of the wprk \nitself, a num her of technical difficulties are involved. Scholars of \nTibetan Buddhism do not find it very difficult to translate the conventional type of Buddhist Sutras and Sastras, for they are all written \nwith established terminologies, phraseologies, and styles. The enigmatic passages of a Tibetan text frequently can be deciphered by means \nof a comparative study of the equivalent text in the Chinese or Sanskrit language. But nothing of this kind is available in the case of the \nMila Grubum; its language, style, and subject matter are in many \nways different from those of conventional Buddhist texts. It was written not only in colloquial Tibetan, but in a form of ancient colloquialism strongly tinged wjth a flavor of the local dialect of Southwestern Tibet. The particular phrases with which Milarepa expressed \nhis Tantric ideas and mystical experiences, present another formidable \nproblem of translation. Moreover, the major part of the book is largely \ncomposed of verses and songs of an \"uncommon\" type, which further \nincreases the difficulties. \nBeing fully aware of these difficulties, I have undertaken this formidable task not without apprehension and concern. I have always been \nof the opinion that a better translation of the Buddhist classics can \nbe achieved only by pooling together the talents of many Buddhist \nscholars (in different fields) to make ~ joint effort in the task, as \ndid King James of England with the translation of the Bible, and \nEmperors Tai Tsung and Khri.SroidDe.bTsan. of China and Tibet \nwith the translations of Buddhist Siitras in the Tang period. Individual \nefforts .in this type of undertaking are always difficult.

Except in Stories 29, \n30, and 31, where the compilers' names -\nShiwa.Hod. and Ran. \nrDson.sTon.Pa.- are given, the name of the compiler of the vast \nmajority of the stories- a total of 58- is not clearly mentioned. It \nis interesting to note, however, that these stories seem to have a uniform style, and, when. compared with Stories 29, 30, and 31, they reveal an outstanding difference, flavor, and superior quality. Beyond \nany doubt they were written by another author. I therefore assume \nthat this compiler or author is the same person as the author of the \nMila Khabum, or Namthar (Mi.La.bKah.hBum., or .rNam.Thar. -\nthe \"Biography of Milarepa\"), namely, the fabulous and mysterious \nyogi, gTsan.sMyon.Heruka.- \"The Mad Yogi from gTsan\"5 -\nwho \nwas a disciple of Phag.Mo.Gru.Pa. (lll0-1170), the celebrated pupil \nof Gambopa (1079-1161), Milarepa's chief disciple. Another strong \npiece of evidence seems also to support this opinion: in the Mila \nKhabum, or Namthar, from Folio 109 to Folio 113, there is a detailed \naccount of Milarepa's life story which is identical with that of the \nGrubum; even the sequence of the stories in the two books is in \nperfect correspondence. There seems to be no other explanation than \nthe fact that both books were compiled by the same person, either in \nthe latter part of the 12th or in the beginning of the 13th century. \nProfessor Herbert V. Guenther, of the Sanskrit University, Varanasi, \nIndia, was so kind as to do some research for me on this problem. \nHis findings are stated in a letter to me, .as follows: \" ... just to let \nyou know that your surmise that the biography of Mi.La.Ras.Pa.

It seems that the confusion with Ras.Chun. \nPa. is due to the fact that gTsan.Pa.Heruka is considered as an incarnation of Ras.Chun.Pa. and as one of the disciples of Phag.Mo.Gru. \nPa .... By this strong evidence the authorship of both the Mila Khabum and the Mila Grubum is thus established to be by Sans.rGyas. \nrGyal.mTshan, the 'Insane Yogi from gTsan,' who bears many different names.\"", "tokens": 810, "page_debut": null}

This classification, of course, should not be treated \ntoo rigidily, for most of the stories contain, in some measure, all three \nelements. \nThe Tibetan text of the Mila Grubum has four major versionsthose of Peking, of Narthang, of Dege, and of Lhasa. The Lhasa \nedition, containing 319 wood-printed folios and 61 stories, has been· \nused in this translation. I believe this edition to be the latest publication among the four, being more or less a reproduction of the Dege \nversion. \nBecause of the complexity and particularity of Tibetan Buddhist \nterminology, explanatory notes for these terms are necessary.

This compromise seems to be \nnecessary since these names are now more or less established in the West. \n7 In order to keep the transliteration as close to the ''Tibetan way\" as possible, the letter :;I\" (Ba) is also transliterated as \"Wa\" after the prefix ~· (Da), \ne.g., dWaii-bShj., not dBaii.bShi. This is because all Tibetans invariably pronounce \nit as \"Wa.\" This, of course, should not be mistakenly identified with the other \nWa ( 'ti\" ), the 20th consonant. This rule is also true in the case where the letter \nis used to form a noun, e.g., dGe.Wa., not dGe.Ba. The root of each Tibetan \nword is always capitalized to facilitate identification. In the case of Z'cf\", ~· , \n~· , E(• , and @\\• - Pha, Tsa, Tsha, Dsa, and Sha- only the first letter of \nth.,root is capitalized.

He was a student of Marpa Lotsawa, and a\nmajor figure in the history of the Kagyu school of Tibetan\nBuddhism.\nHaving meditated on gentleness and on compassion,\nI have forgotten the difference between myself and\nothers.\nFrom the song offered to Geshe Tsaphoua, as\nquoted in Meditation Techniques of the Buddhist\nand Taoist Masters (2003) by Daniel Odier, p. 104\n(https://books.google.it/books?id=9BXTAwAAQBAJ\n&pg=PA104)\nIn my youth I committed black deeds. In maturity I\npractised innocence. Now, released from both good\nand evil, I have destroyed the root of karmic action and\nshall have no reason for action in the future. To say\nmore than this would only cause weeping and\nlaughter. What good would it do to tell you? I am an\nold man. Leave me in peace.\nAs quoted in The Life of Milarepa: A New\nTranslation from the Tibetan (1977) by Tsangnyön\nHeruka, as translated by Lobsang P. Lhalungpa, p. 12\nas translated and edited by Garma C. C. Chang (1975)\nFor those who do not guard their morals,\nPrayers are but wishful thinking.\nFor those who do not practice what they preach,\nOratory is but faithless lying.\np. 17\nI attain all my knowledge through studying my mind within, thus all my thoughts become the\nteachings of Dharma.

But here the Buddha is absent, or perhaps more\nprecisely, Milarepa is the Buddha. The scene is not Vulture Peak in India\nbut Belly Cave in Tibet, and the members of the audience are not the\nfamous monks and bodhisattvas of Indian Buddhism, but Milarepa’s\nTibetan disciples, joined by some local Tibetan deities. The implication of\nthe scene is that there was the Indian Buddha, Śākyamuni; there was\nPadmasambhava, the Indian tantric master who brought Buddhism to Tibet\nin the eighth century, sometimes referred to by Tibetans as “the second\nBuddha”; and there is Milarepa, a Tibetan buddha, born and enlightened in\nTibet, without going to India or receiving the direct instructions of an\nIndian master.\nOne of the standard elements of the Mahāyāna sutras is for Śākyamuni\nBuddha to praise a buddha who resides in another universe, telling stories\nof his former lives as a bodhisattva, describing the glories of the buddha\nfield or pure land that he inhabits. In the biography of Milarepa, his\ndisciple Rechungpa (Ras chung pa, 1084-1161) has a dream in which he\nfinds himself in what seems like a pure land, with buildings made of\nprecious stones and inhabitants dressed in fine brocades. The place is\ncalled “Oddiyāna, Garden of Dākinīs,” indicating that it is a special place\nfor tantric practice; Oddiyāna in northwest India was considered by\nTibetans to be the birthplace of Padmasambhava and the place of origin of\nmany important tantric texts and lineages. In this sacred place, Rechungpa\nis invited to attend the teachings of Aksobhya (“Imperturbable”), the\nbuddha of the East. As Śākyamuni so often did, the buddha Aksobhya\nrecounts the lives of other buddhas and bodhisattvas. He concludes his\ndiscourse by saying, “Tomorrow I shall narrate the life story of Milarepa,\nwhich is even more excellent than those I have just described, so come and\nlisten.” The members of the audience leave the discourse wondering where\nthis buddha Milarepa might reside. Perhaps it is Abhirati, the eastern\nbuddha field of Aksobhya himself, perhaps it is Akanistha, the heaven that\nis the eighth and highest level of the Realm of Form (rū̄padhā̄tu) and,\naccording to many Mahāyāna texts, the abode of the enjoyment body\n(sambhogakā̄ya) of the Buddha. Rechungpa knows, however, that Milarepa\nis in neither place, but is rather in Belly Cave, just a few feet away from\nwhere he is sleeping.\nRechungpa’s dream introduces a theme that runs throughout The Life of\nMilarepa: that there are two parallel universes, one profane and one\nsacred.

There were\nother important figures, but these three, two monks and one layman, two\n\n--- PAGE 11 ---\nTibetans and one Bengali, each contributed to different elements that were\ncentral to what Tibetan historians call the “later dissemination” (phyi dar).\nAmong the one hundred and fifty-seven text translations credited to\nRinchen Sangpo, there are many tantras and tantric commentaries, works\nthat set forth the elaborate world of the mandala, the initiations required to\nenter it, and the practices meant to transform the aspirant into the fully\nenlightened buddha who sits on the throne at the center of the mandala\npalace. Atiśa, although an accomplished tantric practitioner and exegete,\nfocused his teachings on the practices of the bodhisattva, especially the\ncultivation of the aspiration to enlightenment (bodhicitta) and the\nperfection of wisdom (prajñā̄pā̄ramitā) through insight into emptiness\n(́śūnyatā) as set forth by the Madhyamaka philosophers of India. Marpa\nreturned from his journeys to India with tantric texts to be translated but\nalso with oral instructions of the siddha or “adept” tradition of Bengal,\nwhere enlightenment could be triggered by a spontaneous song or, as in the\ncase of Nāropa, by being slapped on the head with the guru’s shoe.\nThese three streams of late Indian Buddhism were just beginning to flow\nfreely into Tibet during the eleventh century and the lifetime of Milarepa\n(1028/40 -1111/23).

It served as a\nvivid inspiration for both the plastic and performing arts across the\nHimalayas.\n\n--- PAGE 17 ---\nOVERVIEW OF MILAREPA’ S LIFE\nWhile The Life of Milarepa paints a striking and often fabulous portrait of\nMilarepa the magician, mendicant, and Buddhist master, we have no\nindependent record of his life from contemporary sources; indeed, we\nknow very little about him as a historical figure at all. Even the dates of his\nbirth and death have long been a source of disagreement among historians,\nboth Tibetan and Western. Tsangnyön Heruka records that the boy was born\nin the male water-dragon year (1052) and passed away in the wood-hare\nyear (1135) at the age of eighty-four—here using the traditional Tibetan\nlunar calendar that forms a sexagenary cycle by combining five elements\nwith twelve animals. Other Tibetan sources move these dates back by one\nor two twelve-year cycles, suggesting instead the years 1040 or 1028 for\nhis birth. Several sources posit his birth as early as 1026 or 1024.\nTranslators of the story outside Tibet have generally agreed upon the dates\n1040-1123, although a number of prominent Tibetan scholars of the\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries favor the earlier span of 1028-1111.\nRegardless of precisely when he was born, Milarepa appeared at the\nbeginning of a new wave of Buddhist expansion in Tibet, a period that\nTibetan historians would come to describe as the “later dissemination”\n(phyi dar). This is contrasted with the “early dissemination” (snga dar),\nwhich took place during the height of the Tibetan empire between the\nseventh and ninth centuries. The period of early dissemination witnessed\nthe introduction of Buddhism to Tibet, the construction of the first Tibetan\nBuddhist monasteries, and the translation of Buddhist texts from Sanskrit\ninto a new Tibetan language, said to have been developed for that purpose.\nTraditional histories describe the disintegration of the Tibetan empire in the\nmid-ninth century, and with it the collapse of Buddhism in central Tibet,\nushering in a so-called dark period lasting some hundred and fifty years.\nAlthough recent evidence calls into question the extent, and even the\nexistence, of such a dark period, a resurgence of religious activity did\nbegin during the eleventh century in western Tibet, marking the onset of the\n“later dissemination.” This was a period in which Tibetan translators\ntraveled to Nepal and India, where they trained with tantric Buddhist\nadepts and returned bearing new philosophical and ritual texts.

Even the dates of his\nbirth and death have long been a source of disagreement among historians,\nboth Tibetan and Western. Tsangnyön Heruka records that the boy was born\nin the male water-dragon year (1052) and passed away in the wood-hare\nyear (1135) at the age of eighty-four—here using the traditional Tibetan\nlunar calendar that forms a sexagenary cycle by combining five elements\nwith twelve animals. Other Tibetan sources move these dates back by one\nor two twelve-year cycles, suggesting instead the years 1040 or 1028 for\nhis birth. Several sources posit his birth as early as 1026 or 1024.\nTranslators of the story outside Tibet have generally agreed upon the dates\n1040-1123, although a number of prominent Tibetan scholars of the\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries favor the earlier span of 1028-1111.\nRegardless of precisely when he was born, Milarepa appeared at the\nbeginning of a new wave of Buddhist expansion in Tibet, a period that\nTibetan historians would come to describe as the “later dissemination”\n(phyi dar). This is contrasted with the “early dissemination” (snga dar),\nwhich took place during the height of the Tibetan empire between the\nseventh and ninth centuries. The period of early dissemination witnessed\nthe introduction of Buddhism to Tibet, the construction of the first Tibetan\nBuddhist monasteries, and the translation of Buddhist texts from Sanskrit\ninto a new Tibetan language, said to have been developed for that purpose.\nTraditional histories describe the disintegration of the Tibetan empire in the\nmid-ninth century, and with it the collapse of Buddhism in central Tibet,\nushering in a so-called dark period lasting some hundred and fifty years.\nAlthough recent evidence calls into question the extent, and even the\nexistence, of such a dark period, a resurgence of religious activity did\nbegin during the eleventh century in western Tibet, marking the onset of the\n“later dissemination.” This was a period in which Tibetan translators\ntraveled to Nepal and India, where they trained with tantric Buddhist\nadepts and returned bearing new philosophical and ritual texts. Milarepa’s\nprincipal teacher, known as Marpa the Translator, was one such individual,\nand famously made three trips to India in search of new teachings. Several\nsects of Tibetan Buddhism, including Milarepa’s own Kagyu (bka’ brgyud,\n“oral transmission”), likewise trace their lineage back to this period.\nIndeed, members of the Kagyu sect venerate Marpa and Milarepa as the\nprimary founders of their lineage in Tibet.\n\n--- PAGE 18 ---\nIt was during this swell of renewed interest in Buddhism that Milarepa\nwas born in the small village of Kyangatsa in southern Tibet, not far from\nthe modern border of Nepal. The Life of Milarepa describes his ancestors\nas nomads from the north, one of whom was a Nyingma tantric practitioner\nnamed Khyungpo Josey. He became famous for his proficiency in\nsubjugating harmful spirits, a talent that earned him both respect and wealth\nfrom the local community. During one such encounter with an especially\npernicious spirit, Josey caused the demon to cry out in horror “mila, mila,”\nan admission of submission and defeat, not unlike crying “uncle.” Josey\nthen adopted this exclamation as a new clan title and his descendants came\nto be known by the name Mila. Khyungpo Josey’s great-grandson\neventually gambled away his inheritance and the family was forced to\nleave in search of a new life elsewhere. Resettling at Kyangatsa, in the\nregion of Mangyul Gungtang, they slowly regained their wealth. This\nallowed them to purchase agricultural land and construct a new manor\nhouse called Kazhi Dunggyé (four columns eight beams), an indication of\nits size, and described as “one of the most pleasant homes in Kyangatsa.”\nMilarepa, and later his younger sister Peta Gönkyi, were thus born into a\nprosperous and powerful family. At the time of his birth, here revealing the\ntraditional preference for male offspring, his father declared, “I am\ndelighted to hear the news that the child has been born a son,” and so\nnamed him Töpaga, literally “delightful to hear.” The boy proved to have a\npleasing voice and a natural gift for song, thereby living up to his name. He\nwas later betrothed to a local village girl named Dzesé. Toward the end of\nthe first chapter, Milarepa describes his family in this way: “We held great\nauthority and influence throughout the region, so the local nobility became\naligned with our family and the peasants came into our service.” At this\npoint in the story, Milarepa seems destined for a quiet and comfortable life.\nWhen the boy turned seven, his father was stricken with a fatal illness\nand prepared a testament that entrusted his wife, children, and wealth to the\ncare of Milarepa’s paternal uncle and aunt, with the provision that\nMilarepa regain his patrimony when he reached adulthood. The rapacious\nuncle and aunt instead appropriated the estate for themselves, casting\nMilarepa’s family into a life of terrible poverty. While the boy was sent\naway to study reading and writing, the relatives forced his mother and\nsister to labor as servants. “With flavorless food, tattered clothing, and\nmiserable spirits,” Milarepa sadly reflects, “we did not know any\nhappiness.”\nDriven to the brink of madness by the decline in their fortunes,\nMilarepa’s mother then advanced a plan to exact revenge upon the aunt and\nuncle, revealing the depth of her hatred in a near-hysterical appeal to her", "tokens": 1321, "page_debut": null}

But they also retained their memories of the departed guru, his\nteachings on the nature of mind, his songs of realization, and his vivid\nexample of perseverance in the face of all adversity—the elements that\nwould later constitute the relic of his life story.\n\n--- PAGE 23 ---\nTHE LIFE OF MILAREPA AS A WORK OF LITERATURE\nSince at least the nineteenth century, The Life of Milarepa has served as a\nprimary source for the Western study of Tibet’s religious and literary\ntraditions.

Instead, in the colophon at the conclusion of the story he signs the\ntext with the epithet “Rupé Gyenchen (dressed in bone ornaments), the\nyogin who wanders in charnel grounds.” This image is that of the tantric\nsiddhas of India, antinomian figures who lived on the margins of society,\nfar from both village and monastic life. The name was cause for confusion\namong early translators of the biography, who either read the first-person\nnarrative as an autobiography in Milarepa’s own hand or saw the framing\ntale as an indication that the story was written by Rechungpa, Milarepa’s\nclose disciple. It was not until the 1960s that scholars of Tibetan literature\nidentified the author of the narrative as the individual called Tsangnyön\nHeruka, the “Madman of Tsang.”\nTsangnyön Heruka was born in 1452, a period of regional and sectarian\nconflict in central and western Tibet. (Tsang is Tibet’s western province\nand thus forms the first syllable of his name.) But it was also a time of great\nreligious and intellectual innovation. He was one of several individuals\nidentified during this period as religious madmen. The unconventional\nconduct of such figures is traditionally believed to reflect a profound\nrealization of the true nature of reality, one that no longer discriminates\nbetween pure and impure, virtue and sin, secular and sacred. Modern\nscholars have interpreted such behavior as a reaction against the rising\nwealth and power of Tibet’s monastic institutions by returning to a model\nof the itinerant yogin’s life. Indeed, Tsangnyön Heruka spent much of his\nadult career emulating Milarepa.\nAlthough Tsangnyön Heruka was ordained as a monk in his youth, at the\nage of twenty-one he renounced his monastic vows. He trained under\nteachers from various sects of Tibetan Buddhism, but his central interest\nwas the so-called aural transmissions of Rechungpa (ras chung snyan\nrgyud), a corpus of carefully guarded tantric instructions passed on from\nNāropa to Marpa to Milarepa, and then taught by Milarepa’s disciple\nRechungpa. He then spent many years in solitary retreat, during which time\nhe exhibited transgressive and antinomian behavior. Upon his returning\nfrom the mountain wilderness of Tsari in southern Tibet with his body\nsmeared in human ashes and blood and the fingers and toes of human\ncorpses woven into his hair, local villagers are said to have given him the\ntitle Nyönpa (smyon pa), or “madman.” He later received the epithets\nTraktung Gyalpo (khrag thung rgyal po), “King Blood Drinker,” which\nincorporates the Tibetan translation for the Indian term heruka (khrag", "tokens": 1118, "page_debut": null}

By the late nineteenth century, both\nMilarepa and his biography had become an important subject of study for\nscholars of Tibet in Europe and North America. The Life served as a\nprincipal reference for the Tibetan-English dictionaries of the Moravian\nmissionary H. A. Jäschke and the British spy Sarat Chandra Das, published\nin 1881 and 1902 respectively. In 1925, the French Tibetologist Jacques\nBacot published an extensive, though incomplete, translation of the\nbiography under the title Le poète tibétain Milarépa: ses crimes, ses\népreuves, son Nirvā̄na. Although Bacot omitted the final chapter describing\nMilarepa’s death, this was one of the first comprehensive accounts of a\nTibetan figure in a European language, and the translation remains an\nimpressive achievement.\nThe story appeared in English for the first time in 1928 as Tibet’s Great\nYogī Milarepa, the second of a quartet of books edited by W. Y. EvansWentz, an eccentric American spiritual seeker and would-be scholar.\nAlthough Evans-Wentz could not read Tibetan, he collaborated with the\nSikkimese national Kazi Dawa Samdup (1868-1922), who was employed\nat the time as the headmaster of the Maharaja’s Bhutia Boarding School in\nGangtok and later taught at the University of Calcutta. Dawa Samdup had\nworked intermittently on a translation of the Life between 1902 and 1917,\nwell before Bacot’s publication appeared. But it was only after the\nSikkimese translator died in 1922 that Evans-Wentz took an interest in the\naccount of Milarepa’s life. He received the manuscript of Dawa Samdup’s\ntranslation from the translator’s family in 1924 and published it four years\nlater. Although this constituted the first complete English translation of the\nstory (lacking only the opening kā̄vya-style verses), its language is\nencumbered by an excessively biblical style, likely added by Evans-Wentz\nto Dawa Samdup’s generally accurate translation.\nThe text achieved even greater fame in the West through the efforts of\nLobsang Lhalungpa (1924-2008), who published a new translation in 1977\nas The Life of Milarepa. Lhalungpa served as a government official in\nTibet prior to exile; he later acted as an interpreter for the fourteenth Dalai\nLama and pioneered the first Tibetan-language program for All India\nRadio. \nAlthough \noccasionally \nerring \nwhen \naddressing \nBuddhist\nterminology and often overly free in its rendering of poetry, Lhalungpa’s\ntranslation effectively served as the voice of Milarepa for a generation of\nreaders.", "tokens": 1131, "page_debut": null}

Although this constituted the first complete English translation of the\nstory (lacking only the opening kā̄vya-style verses), its language is\nencumbered by an excessively biblical style, likely added by Evans-Wentz\nto Dawa Samdup’s generally accurate translation.\nThe text achieved even greater fame in the West through the efforts of\nLobsang Lhalungpa (1924-2008), who published a new translation in 1977\nas The Life of Milarepa. Lhalungpa served as a government official in\nTibet prior to exile; he later acted as an interpreter for the fourteenth Dalai\nLama and pioneered the first Tibetan-language program for All India\nRadio. \nAlthough \noccasionally \nerring \nwhen \naddressing \nBuddhist\nterminology and often overly free in its rendering of poetry, Lhalungpa’s\ntranslation effectively served as the voice of Milarepa for a generation of\nreaders.\n\n--- PAGE 29 ---\nThe Tibetan source for each of these translations is Tsangnyön Heruka’s\ncomposition entitled The Life of the Powerful Lord of Yogins Jetsün\nMilarepa, Demonstrating the Path of Liberation and Omniscience (Rnal\n’byor gyi dbang phyug chen po rje btsun mi la ras pa’i rnam thar thar pa\ndang thams cad mkhyen pa’i lam ston). Although prints from Tsangnyön\nHeruka’s original wood blocks have not yet come to light, nearly two dozen\neditions are known to have been printed across Tibet by the mid-twentieth\ncentury. For the present translation I have relied mainly on the critical\nedition by J. W. de Jong, who in turn based his work on editions produced\nin four locations: Spung thang, Bstan rgyas gling, Spo, and Bkra shis lhun\npo. I have also extensively consulted the editions from Ron ’Od gsal phug\n(perhaps the oldest extant edition) and Sde dge, as well as the modern\nChinese reprint. For comparison, I have read many parallel sections from\nversions of the life story that predate Tsangnyön Heruka’s text, including the\nso-called Twelve Great Disciples (Bu chen bcu gnyis), A River of\nBlessings Relieving the Tormenting Heat of the Mental Af flictions (Byin\nbrlabs kyi chu rgyun gyis nyon mongs pa’i tsha gdung sel bar byed pa),\nand The Life of Jetsün Milarepa: An *Illuminating Lamp of Sun and\nMoon Beams (Rje btsun mid la ras pa’i rnam par thar pa gsal byed nyi\nzla’i ’od zer gyi sgron ma) by G.yung ston Zhi byed Ri khrod pa (born ca.\n1320).\nIn the translation, I have generally sought to strike the delicate balance\nbetween faithfulness to the text and transparency of its meaning. I have\nattempted as much as possible to avoid the technical jargon of Buddhism\nand “translationese” by rendering all words into English instead of\nreverting anachronistically to Sanskrit—recognizing of course that this runs\nthe risk of creating a new form of English jargon. Some terms may therefore\nappear unconventional (such as “life’s round” for the Tibetan ’khor ba\n[saṃsā̄ra]). I have left several Tibetan words untranslated, including repa\n(ras pa), and Jetsün (rje btsun). The former economically avoids repeating\nthe somewhat cumbersome “cotton-clad,” especially in songs where\nMilarepa uses the term self-referentially.

Rechungpa prostrated himself at the buddha’s feet, requested\nblessings, and sat before him listening to the dharma. The buddha smiled\nand Rechungpa thought, “The buddha has been gazing directly at me for a\nlittle while and is thinking of me with affection.”\nThe dharma discourse focused entirely upon the genealogies, birth\naccounts, deeds, and life stories of all the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and as\nthe buddha taught them, Rechungpa felt a faith that caused the hair on his\nbody to quiver. Finally, he recounted the life stories of Tilopa, Nāropa, and\nMarpa, which were more extensive and even more amazing than when the\nJetsün had told them previously. The entire assembly was thus completely\novercome with faith.\nAt the conclusion of his religious discourse, the buddha said,\n“Tomorrow I shall narrate the life story of Milarepa, which is even more\nexcellent than those I have just described, so come and listen.” Some in the\nassembly said, “There couldn’t be anything more excellent than the\nprevious accounts; if there were it would be a marvel of immeasurable\nproportions.” Others said, “The spiritual qualities of those who were\npreviously described are fruits attained through the accumulation of merit\nand the purification of obscurations during the course of many lifetimes.\nMilarepa attained spiritual qualities not inferior to those previous masters\nin one lifetime and one body.” The first people said, “Well then, if there is\nsuch a marvelous dharma teaching and we failed to request it for the benefit\nof sentient beings, we would be unfit disciples. We should therefore have\nstrength and determination in our three gates, and request it for the benefit\nof beings.”\nSomeone else asked, “Where does Milarepa currently reside?” Some\nsaid, “He resides either in Abhirati or Akaniṣṭha.” Rechungpa then thought,\n“The Jetsün presently resides in Tibet.

In particular, wherever the\nJetsün abides is itself Abhirati and Akaniṣṭha. You are totally mistaken and\nfilled with disbelief.”\nAfterward, he thought, “In my dream, the one who was teaching dharma,\nBharima who was listening to it, and all the other signs were indications\nthat I should request the Jetsün’s life story for the benefit of beings.\nTherefore I should request it by all means.” He was filled with an\nextraordinary devotion to the lama and he prayed from the depths of his\nheart and the marrow of his bones. He rested in this state for a little while,\nand within an experience that was a mixture of dream state and luminosity,\nfive beautiful maidens appeared, standing in a row before Rechungpa:\nwhite, blue, yellow, red, and green, wearing the ornaments and clothing of\nOḍḍiyāna.\nOne of them said, “Milarepa’s life story will be told tomorrow. Let us go\nand listen.”\nAnother asked, “Who will request it?”\n“The senior heart-disciples will request it,” responded another. All the\nwhile, they fluttered their eyes at Rechungpa.\nOne of them said, “Everyone would be delighted to hear such a\nmarvelous teaching, so we should each offer a fervent prayer.”\nAnother said, “It is proper for the senior disciples to request the life\nstory. It has instead fallen upon each of us to protect and propagate the\nmaster’s teaching.” Having said this, they vanished like a rainbow.\nRechungpa then awoke from this state of luminosity. The dawn sun rose\nbrilliantly in the sky. He reflected, “I have understood the tidings of the five\nSisters of Long Life.” He prepared a meal while resting in a state of postmeditative experience. When he had eaten his fill, he went before the lama\nand found him surrounded by a resplendent, colorful assembly of resident\ndisciples and lay followers.

My\nclan is Khyungpo. My family line is Josey. I am Milarepa. First I committed\nevil deeds. Later on I practiced virtue.

He was then\ngiven the name Khyungpo Josey and remained in the region for several\nyears.\nWhatever calamities fell, due to illness, harmful spirits, and so forth, he\nwas the individual who was called upon. Once there was a malicious\ndemon that could not go near Josey but was insurmountably fearsome for\neveryone else. The demon descended upon a family that had very little faith\nin Josey, inflicting it with harm. The family called upon another lama, who\nperformed a rite of wrathful subjugation and offered blessings, but they\nwere of no use; the demon argued back, ridiculing and condemning the\nlama. At that point, unbeknownst to the demon, a relative of the faithless\nfamily advised them to invite Khyungpo Josey, stating, “One uses even dog\nfat if it cures the wound.

I eat the flesh and drink the blood of\ndemons and obstructing spirits, so just you wait.” He sprang forth as he\nsaid this and even before he closed in, the demon was stricken with fear.\nTaken by surprise, it cried out again and again, “O mother, O father.

Wagering greater\nstakes than before, they cast the sho dice, and the man let himself be beaten\nthree times. Finally he said, “I, too, should be allowed to get even.” They\nagreed upon the size of the stakes and wagered their fields, their homes,\nand their personal wealth. They bound themselves by written contract so\nthat there was no room for dispute and then they rolled the dice. The man\nwon. His paternal relations seized control of Mila Dorjé Sengé’s fields,\nhome, and personal wealth.\nThe two Milas, father and son, then set out from the region, leaving their\nhome and everything they knew. They reached a place called Kyangatsa in\nMangyul Gungtang, and then settled down. The father, Dotön Sengé, carried\nout village rituals for the local inhabitants such as reading and reciting\nscriptures, offering ritual cakes, providing protection from hailstorms, and\nperforming rites for protecting children. His services, which were very\nmuch in demand, brought him many offerings. During winter the son Dorjé\nSengé undertook major trading trips to gather goods from Nepal in the\nsouth. During summer he gathered goods from nomad lands in the north. He\nalso engaged in minor trade, gathering goods throughout Mangyul Gungtang.\nIn this way, the father and son accumulated a great deal of wealth.\nAt that time, the son Dorjé Sengé loved a local maiden and the two\nmarried. To the couple was born a son who received the name Mila Sherab\nGyaltsen. While they were raising him, his grandfather Dotön Sengé passed\naway, and they performed an extensive funeral. Afterward, Mila Dorjé\nSengé increased his fortune through trade and became wealthier than ever\nbefore. There was a man named Orma in the vicinity of Tsa who owned a\nfine, triangular field in Tsa.

Wagering greater\nstakes than before, they cast the sho dice, and the man let himself be beaten\nthree times. Finally he said, “I, too, should be allowed to get even.” They\nagreed upon the size of the stakes and wagered their fields, their homes,\nand their personal wealth. They bound themselves by written contract so\nthat there was no room for dispute and then they rolled the dice. The man\nwon. His paternal relations seized control of Mila Dorjé Sengé’s fields,\nhome, and personal wealth.\nThe two Milas, father and son, then set out from the region, leaving their\nhome and everything they knew. They reached a place called Kyangatsa in\nMangyul Gungtang, and then settled down. The father, Dotön Sengé, carried\nout village rituals for the local inhabitants such as reading and reciting\nscriptures, offering ritual cakes, providing protection from hailstorms, and\nperforming rites for protecting children. His services, which were very\nmuch in demand, brought him many offerings. During winter the son Dorjé\nSengé undertook major trading trips to gather goods from Nepal in the\nsouth. During summer he gathered goods from nomad lands in the north. He\nalso engaged in minor trade, gathering goods throughout Mangyul Gungtang.\nIn this way, the father and son accumulated a great deal of wealth.\nAt that time, the son Dorjé Sengé loved a local maiden and the two\nmarried. To the couple was born a son who received the name Mila Sherab\nGyaltsen. While they were raising him, his grandfather Dotön Sengé passed\naway, and they performed an extensive funeral. Afterward, Mila Dorjé\nSengé increased his fortune through trade and became wealthier than ever\nbefore. There was a man named Orma in the vicinity of Tsa who owned a\nfine, triangular field in Tsa. Dorjé Sengé purchased the field, paying out a\ngood quantity of gold and merchandise from the north and south, and it\ncame to be known as Orma Triangle.

He taught them\nhow to undertake the business of commerce, and they too amassed a great\ndeal of wealth through trade.\nSome time later on, Nyangtsa Kargyen became pregnant. Mila Sherab\nGyaltsen, having brought numerous goods from the south, set out to sell\nthem in the vicinity of Taktsé in the north. A long time passed while he was\naway.

The rest sighed deeply.\nThen uncle and aunt said to us, “You say that you need your possessions\nbut you already possess many things. You have laid out a feast for your\nneighbors and countrymen without regard for the meat and beer that you\nsquandered. Your possessions? We don’t have them. Even if we did, we\nwouldn’t give them to you. So if you are many wage war, if you are few\ncast magic.” Having said this, they left. Those who sided with them\nfollowed them out.\nAs my mother sat there weeping hysterically, all those sympathetic to us,\nsuch as my maternal uncle and Dzesé’s father and brothers, stayed behind to\nconsole her. They drank the remaining beer and said to my mother, “Don’t\ncry. Crying won’t help. Beg something from everyone who gathered here\ntoday at the feast tables. All of us here will give what we can. Even Uncle\nand Aunt will give something.”\nMy maternal uncle said, “Do just that, and send the boy to learn a skill.\nYou and your daughter come stay with me and work the fields. It is fitting\nthat you do something useful. In any case, you must not be shamed before\nUncle and Aunt.”\nMy mother replied, “I have no control over our possessions. But I will\nnot support my children with charity. Uncle and Aunt have no intention to\nreturn even a portion of our wealth. I will by all means send my son to\nlearn a skill. Uncle and Aunt did not return to us what was rightfully ours,\nso we will run at the sound of the drum and run at the rising of smoke.7\nThen they will see what we are really like. From here on, we will work the\nfields.”\nIn Mithögeka of Tsa there lived a master of the Nyingmapa mantra\ntradition named Lugyé Khen, who was very much in demand for village\nrituals. I was sent to study reading with him. At that time, our relatives gave\nus a few things they had begged. In particular, Dzesé’s parents gave\nfoodstuffs and fire-wood and then repeatedly sent Dzesé to the place where\nI was learning to read in order to console me. My maternal uncle fed my\nmother and sister so they were not forced to go beg or work for others. My\nmaternal uncle wouldn’t let my mother beg, keeping her continuously\n\n--- PAGE 50 ---\nengaged so that wool she spun on one day was that day woven.

My mother also felt a strong attachment for me,\nher only son, and stayed there watching me with tears in her eyes for as\nlong as I remained in sight. I had the heartrending thought, “Should I turn\nback, should I turn around and see my mother for just a moment?” I felt that\nmother and son would not meet again. Then, when we were out of sight, my\nmother returned home weeping.\nAfter a few days, rumor spread widely that Nyangtsa Kargyen’s son had\ngone off to train in black magic. We took the road to Ü Tsang and reached\nYakdé in Tsangrong. There I sold my horse and dye to a very wealthy man\nand the gold I received as payment I carried on my person. After crossing\nthe Tsangpo, we turned toward Ü and at Tönluk Raka encountered many\nmonks and nuns from Ü. We asked them for the name of a master in the\nregion of Ü skilled in black magic, curses, and casting hail. One of the\nmonks said, “In the village of Kyorpo in Yarlung lives a lama named\nYungtön Trogyal of Nyak. He is an accomplished master of wrathful mantra\npractices such as black magic and curses.” The monk was his disciple.\nSo then, setting out to meet lama Yungtön Trogyal, we reached the village\nof Kyorpo in Yarlung. When we met the lama, my companions presented\nonly trifling gifts, but I offered everything, gold and turquoise. I said, “I\nfurther offer my body, speech, and mind.

Have pity and give me your\nmost potent black magic, one that will show signs of working in my region.\nUntil then, out of compassion, please give me food and clothing.”\nThe lama smiled and replied, “I shall think over what you have said.”\nBut from that point on he did not teach us the deepest black magic.\nRather, he gave us a few evil mantras that he claimed would make heaven\nand earth tremble and clash, as well as a few useful instructions together\nwith their ritual practices. About a year passed in this way, and as my\ncompanions were all preparing to leave, the lama offered them each a fine\ncloak he had sewn from woolen cloth of central Tibet. But I was not\nconvinced. I thought it would be difficult for the black magic I had learned\nto show signs of working in my region. And my mother would surely kill\nherself were I to return home without showing signs of magic.

In the\nregion called Nup Khulung in Tsangrong lives the Khulungpa lama named\nYönten Gyatso, knowledgeable in both medicine and mantra, and I gave\nthis practice to him. He possesses the practice of casting hailstorms by\npointing one’s finger, which he gave to me. As we then became close\nfriends, those who come to me to study black magic I send to him and those\nwho go to him to study hail casting he sends to me. For this reason, I will\nalso send you to him together with my son.”\nHe provided me and his elder son named Darma Wangchuk with a\ncrossbred yak loaded with thick wool and blended flannel from Ü province\ntogether with a small gift and sealed letter. Having then reached Nup\nKhulung in Tsangrong, we met lama Nubchungwa Yönten Gyatso and\noffered him the woolens along with the gift and letter from the lama.\nExplaining the circumstances of my situation in detail, I requested that he\nagree to teach me black magic.\nThe lama said, “The lama has been my friend for a long time and is true\nto his word. I shall certainly teach you two the instructions for black magic.\nOn that mountain spur down there, construct a retreat cell where you will\nnot be disturbed by human hands.”\nThe cell had three stories below and one story above in which we\nplaced sturdy beams, aligned side by side like rows of fish. We secured the\nperimeter with boulders nearly the size of yaks, leaving no gaps between\nthem. We thus made the retreat cell so that others could neither discover its\ndoor nor find a way to infiltrate its walls. The master then gave instructions\non black magic. We practiced the magic and seven days passed. The lama\ncame and said, “In the past, seven days were sufficient. That should be\nenough this time too.”\nI replied, “Since this is black magic cast from a great distance, I ask that\nwe continue for another seven days.”\n“In that case,” he said, “continue to practice.”\nOn the evening of the fourteenth day, the lama returned and said,", "tokens": 1401, "page_debut": null}

In the\nregion called Nup Khulung in Tsangrong lives the Khulungpa lama named\nYönten Gyatso, knowledgeable in both medicine and mantra, and I gave\nthis practice to him. He possesses the practice of casting hailstorms by\npointing one’s finger, which he gave to me. As we then became close\nfriends, those who come to me to study black magic I send to him and those\nwho go to him to study hail casting he sends to me. For this reason, I will\nalso send you to him together with my son.”\nHe provided me and his elder son named Darma Wangchuk with a\ncrossbred yak loaded with thick wool and blended flannel from Ü province\ntogether with a small gift and sealed letter. Having then reached Nup\nKhulung in Tsangrong, we met lama Nubchungwa Yönten Gyatso and\noffered him the woolens along with the gift and letter from the lama.\nExplaining the circumstances of my situation in detail, I requested that he\nagree to teach me black magic.\nThe lama said, “The lama has been my friend for a long time and is true\nto his word. I shall certainly teach you two the instructions for black magic.\nOn that mountain spur down there, construct a retreat cell where you will\nnot be disturbed by human hands.”\nThe cell had three stories below and one story above in which we\nplaced sturdy beams, aligned side by side like rows of fish. We secured the\nperimeter with boulders nearly the size of yaks, leaving no gaps between\nthem. We thus made the retreat cell so that others could neither discover its\ndoor nor find a way to infiltrate its walls. The master then gave instructions\non black magic. We practiced the magic and seven days passed. The lama\ncame and said, “In the past, seven days were sufficient. That should be\nenough this time too.”\nI replied, “Since this is black magic cast from a great distance, I ask that\nwe continue for another seven days.”\n“In that case,” he said, “continue to practice.”\nOn the evening of the fourteenth day, the lama returned and said,\n\n--- PAGE 56 ---\n“Tonight, signs of black magic will appear at the edge of the mandala.”\nThat night, oath-bound protectors of the teachings appeared carrying thirtyfive human heads and hearts, covered in blood. They said, “For some days,\nyou have called upon us and this is just what you have asked for,” and they\npiled the heads and hearts at the edge of the mandala.\nIn the morning, the lama returned and said, “There remain two people to\nbe liberated. Should they be killed or spared?”\n“Spare them,” I replied, “in order to make known my satisfaction and\njustice.” They were left alone, and thus my uncle and aunt were spared. We\noffered ritual cakes and a thanksgiving feast to the oath-bound dharma\nprotectors and then left the retreat. Remains of the retreat cell are still\npresent in Khulung.\nMeanwhile, I wondered how signs of black magic had manifested in my\nhomeland of Kyangatsa. There had been a wedding feast for my uncle’s\nelder son to receive his bride. Thirty-five people who despised us gathered\nin the house, led by my uncle’s sons and their wives. Other guests and those\npartial to us talked among themselves on the way to the house. They said,\n“As the saying goes, ‘When the false master aims to be master, the master is\nput out like a dog,’ so too have these terrible people acted. If the power of\nTöpaga’s incantation does not work against them, the power of the truth of\nthe Precious Jewels will.”\nThose who were coming to the gathering had not yet entered the house,\nand my uncle and aunt stood outside discussing what food to offer and what\ngreeting to pay to each person. At that moment, a former servant of mine\nwho now worked for my uncle went to draw water. She did not see the\nmany horses tethered in the courtyard, but instead saw it filled with\nscorpions, spiders, snakes, tadpoles, and the like. In their midst stood a\nscorpion as big as a yak, thrusting its claws around a pillar and tearing it\nout. She fled in terror, and just as she landed outside, the many stallions that\nwere tethered together with the mares riled the females, causing all the\nhorses to startle and rear, while the mares kicked at the stallions. Pillars\nwere struck and they toppled. The house collapsed, and under the rubble\nsome thirty-five people died, including my uncle’s sons and their wives.\nThe house was filled with corpses and shrouded in a swirl of dust.\nSeeing the calamity that filled the area outside, Peta rushed to my mother\nand gave an account, saying, “Mother! Mother! Uncle’s house has collapsed\nand many people have died. Come look.”\nMy mother wondered whether it was true or not and, overwhelmed with\njoy, she went to look. Upon seeing my uncle’s house reduced to a swirling\ncloud of dust and hearing the valley filled with mournful cries, she was as\nhappy as she was astonished.

So please think kindly of me and\ngive me the instructions for casting hail.”\nHe replied, “If you need hail, go see Yungtön Trogyal.” The lama gave\nme a letter together with some gifts, and once again I went to the village of\nKyorpo in Yarlung.\nI met the lama and presented him with an offering of three ounces of\ngold, as well as lama Yönten Gyatso’s letter and gifts. I described how I\nneeded to cast hailstorms and he asked, “Was your black magic\nsuccessful?”\n“The magic was successful,” I replied. “Thirty-five people perished.\nNow, in addition, I received a letter saying that I need to cast hailstorms, so\nplease think kindly of me.”\n“So be it,” said the lama. He gave me the instructions and I went to\n\n--- PAGE 61 ---\npractice them in my old retreat cell. After seven days, a cloud gathered\ninside the magical pit, lightning flashed, and thunder rumbled. Thus I\nthought I could direct a hailstorm by pointing my finger.\nThe lama repeatedly asked me, “Since you are casting a hailstorm, how\nhigh are the crops now in your region?”\nI replied first, “They have just barely sprouted,” and then some time\nlater, “The seedlings are just high enough to hide the pigeons.”\n“It is a little too early,” said the lama. Later he asked again, “Now how\nhigh are they?”\n“The ears of grain are just beginning to come out,” I replied.\n“In that case, it is time to go cast the hailstorm,” said the lama. He sent\nthe messenger who had already been to my village as my companion, and\ndisguised as yogins we set off. In my region the elders could not remember\nhaving had such a good year, and a law was established forbidding people\nfrom harvesting the crops whenever they pleased. When we arrived, the\nharvest was due to be reaped the next day and the day after. I prepared for\nthe practice in the upper end of the valley. Then I repeated the mantras and\na cloud gathered, barely the size of a small bird. This was not what I had\nhoped for. So I invoked the names of the oath-bound protectors and\nproclaimed the truth of how my countrymen had abused me. I pounded my\ncloak and shed many tears. Then suddenly a black cloud, unimaginably\nvast, gathered in the sky. It converged into a single mass and at that instant\nhailstones beat down upon the grain, covering the entire valley three bricks\ndeep. The whole mountainside was washed into ravines. Seeing the loss of\ntheir harvest, the villagers wept. Afterward, a tremendous rainstorm set in.\nAs my companion and I were chilled, we lit a fire of tamarisk wood in a\ncave whose entrance faced north, and there we stayed.\nSome locals, who had gone hunting for the harvest thanksgiving, said,\n“This Töpaga has wreaked suffering upon our countrymen as no one else\never has. He has already slain so many men. Now he has wiped out this\nyear’s excellent crops. If he fell into our hands, we would rip out his stillbeating heart, and each of us would take a bit of flesh and a drop of blood.\nBut even this would not relieve the pain we feel in our hearts.” As they\nwere saying this, they passed in front of our cave on their way down the\nmountain. An old man said, “Silence! Silence! Speak softly. There is smoke\nin that cave over there and we don’t know who it is.”\nThe younger men said, “It must be Töpaga.

If we don’t kill him, he will\nbring still further ruin to the region.” With this, they turned back.\nMy companion said, “You go on ahead.

Do you also intend to murder us\nby bringing down the house with your brute strength? You’re altogether\nunfit, so get rid of your barley.” And he pushed it away with his foot so that\nI was forced to take it outside for a while. Without thinking badly of him, I\nsimply said to myself, “It seems that the lama has a fierce temper. I must\nwatch how I behave and render service when in his presence.”\nThen as an offering I presented the empty copper kettle and bowed\ndown. He held the kettle in his hands and for a while stood there pensive,\nhis eyes half-shut. At last, tears trickled down his face and he said, “This is\nmost auspicious. I offer it to Paṇchen Nāro.” He raised the kettle in his\nhands, sounded the handles, and struck it with a switch, ringing it as loudly\nas he could. He then carried it in to his shrine room where he filled it with\nmelted butter from the butter lamps and set it down. At that moment, I was\novercome with revulsion for the world and stricken by an intense longing\nfor dharma. I repeatedly begged the lama to impart the dharma and his oral\ninstructions.\nThe lama replied, “I have a great many faithful disciples coming from Ü\nand Tsang.

You will not need to tear this one down.”\nI began building a triangular tower. When I had finished about one-third\nof the construction, the lama arrived. “Great Magician, whose tower are\nyou building? Who gave you instructions?” he demanded.\n“Surely the lama himself ordered the tower for his son,” I replied.\nHe said, “I don’t recall giving any such instructions. If what you say is\nindeed true, I must be either absentminded or completely crazy.”\n“At the time,” I reminded him, “I feared something like this might happen\nand I requested that you carefully consider the matter. You said that you had\nconsidered it carefully, and that this time I wouldn’t need to tear it down. I\nclearly remember this.”\n“Well then,” the lama replied, “who is your witness of this? Did you\nintend to lock me up here in this tower, which looks like a triangular magic\ndungeon, and cast your spells? I have neither plundered your estate nor\nsquandered your patrimony. If that is not the case and you indeed desire\ndharma, then, since the local guardians are displeased, carry the tower’s\nearth and stones back to the places you found them.

Be compassionate and grant Great Magician the dharma.”\nHe replied, “Prepare a good meal and then bring him to me.” Carrying\nthe meal with her, the lady brought me before the lama. “Great Magician,”\nhe said, “do not accuse me, as you did yesterday, of a deception I did not\ncommit.

If that is not the case and you indeed desire\ndharma, then, since the local guardians are displeased, carry the tower’s\nearth and stones back to the places you found them. Then if you want the\ndharma, I shall grant it. If you won’t do it, then leave.” Speaking in this\nway, he worked himself into a rage.\nI was overcome by deep depression but still yearned for dharma. So in\naccordance with the lama’s instructions, for the triangular tower as well, I\ncarried the earth and stones back to the places I found them. Meanwhile, a\nsore appeared on my back. I thought, “If I show it to the lama, he will only\nscold me. If I show it to the lady, it will look like I’m complaining about\nmy work.” I kept the sore to myself and wept. Then I called upon the lady\nto help me request the dharma. She went before the lama and said, “I know\nnow that you are insufferable since you have assigned such pointless work\non these towers. Be compassionate and grant Great Magician the dharma.”\nHe replied, “Prepare a good meal and then bring him to me.” Carrying\nthe meal with her, the lady brought me before the lama. “Great Magician,”\nhe said, “do not accuse me, as you did yesterday, of a deception I did not\ncommit. If you want the dharma, I shall grant it.” He gave me the\n\n--- PAGE 73 ---\ntransmission and vows of ordinary refuge. He added, “That is all called\nordinary dharma. If you wish for the extraordinary oral instructions of\nSecret Mantra, you must act in this way.” Then he narrated a brief account\nof Nāropa’s life and his practice of austerities, concluding, “It will be\ndifficult for you to live up to such an example.”\nThis engendered a powerful faith that moved me to tears, and I resolved\nto do whatever the lama commanded.\nSeveral days passed and the lama asked that I attend him during a walk,\nwhich I did. We reached the land protected by the lama’s paternal relatives.\nHe said, “Now, in this place you shall build a square tower, pale gray in\ncolor, nine stories tall, with a spire reaching the tenth story. It will never be\ntorn down. When it is finished, I will give you the oral instructions. You\nmay then enter meditation retreat and I will supply your provisions.”\n“In that case,” I replied, “might the lady be present as a witness to these\npromises?”\n“Very well,” said the lama. He then drew an outline for the foundation\nand I invited the lama’s wife. In the presence of both lama and lady I said,\n“I have already built three towers and I have torn them down. The first\ntime, the lama said he had not considered the matter. The second time, he\nsaid he was drunk. The third time, he asked if he were absentminded or\ncompletely crazy. When I reminded him of the instructions he had given me,\nhe asked who was my witness and then scolded me at length. This time I\nhave invited the lady as a witness to these promises, so please attest to\nthem.”\nThe lady replied, “It is fine for me to serve as witness, but the lama is a\nstrong-willed judge and will not likely consider my testimony. To start\nwith, the lama is building towers without reason and tearing them down\nwithout reason. More to the point, this land is not ours alone. It has been\npledged to all our relatives and will so become a source of infighting. Even\nif I plead, the lama will not listen to me.”\nThe lama said to his wife, “You shall serve as a witness. I will act as I\nhave promised. I will not have you raise objections to serving in this way.\nNow go.”\nThen I laid the foundation for a square tower. While I was building the\nwalls, Ngoktön Chödor of Zhung, Tsurtön Wangé of Dol, and Metön Tsönpo\nof Tsangron playfully rolled a boulder into place as a foundation stone.\nWhen I had reached the second story beside the main door, Marpa arrived.\nHe looked everything over and was pleased. Then, pointing a finger at the\nstone that had been rolled into place by his three senior disciples, he asked,\n“Great Magician, where did this stone come from?”\nI replied, “Your three senior heart-son disciples playfully brought it", "tokens": 1375, "page_debut": null}

Remove the stone and carry it back to the place it came from.”\n“But you promised that this tower would not be torn down,” I replied.\n“That is so. But it is not fitting that my disciples, who are practicing the\ntwo stages of yoga, be pressed into service as your servants. Don’t tear\ndown the entire structure, but remove the stone and return it to the place it\ncame from.”\nSo I tore down the tower from the top down and returned the stone to its\nplace. “Now,” the lama said, “once again fetch the boulder and set it down\nas a foundation stone.”\nLifting it up I had to exert as much strength alone as all three of them\ntogether, but I returned it as it was before without much difficulty. It became\nknown as my strongman stone.\nWhile I was laying the foundation on the mountain spur, the paternal\nrelatives all held council and said, “Marpa is building fortifications on the\noath-bound mountain, so we must defend our land.” Some said, “Marpa has\ngone crazy and has a very strong novice from Latö building towers on\nevery outcropping and mountain spur without a plan. When they are half\nfinished, he is being forced to tear them down and to return the earth and\nstones to the places he found them. He will tear this one down too. If he\ndoes not, we are right to defend our land. Let us watch if he tears it down\nor not.”\nI did not tear it down, but worked on the tower continuously. By the time\nI reached the seventh story, a sore had appeared on my waist. The paternal\nrelatives then said, “Now, he is not going to tear it down. The first ones he\ndemolished were a cover for building this one. We will destroy it\nourselves.” With this, they prepared their forces. Just then, the lama\nconjured miraculous emanations filling the tower inside and out with a\nband of armor-clad soldiers.

I felt at that\ntime that I must seek another lama. But thinking it over carefully, I was\nconvinced that no other lama but this one had the oral instructions for\nattaining buddhahood in one life and one body. I thought, “Even if I don’t\nattain buddhahood right now, at least I have ceased accumulating karma for\nrebirth in the lower realms later on. When I have suffered trials for the sake\nof the dharma as did Nāropa, the lama will be pleased and I will obtain the\noral instructions.

I requested the lady to come.\nThe lama asked her, “Dakmema, where did we get this turquoise?”\nThe lama’s wife offered many prostrations.

The turquoise is mine.”\nI lingered, wondering if the lady might renew her request in the fervor of\noffering the turquoise. But the lama turned furious and sprang up saying,\n“What impudence!

Elated,\nshe said, “You have done just the right thing. Now it seems the lama will\ngrant you the dharma.

Again and again the\nlady had the resident disciples bow before the lama and ply him with the\nstrong first pouring of beer. The lady and I repeatedly filled the bowl. The\nresident disciples drank the moderate draft, while the lady only brought the\nweak beer to her lips and did not drink much. I did likewise and remained\nsober. The resident disciples, however, became drunk. As for the lama,\nwith many people offering him strong beer, he became quite drunk and fell\ninto a deep sleep.\nMeanwhile the lady took the lama’s seal, as well as Nāropa’s six\nornaments and rosary made of ruby, from his residence. She had a letter\nalready prepared that was made to look like the lama’s own written\nstatement, and she affixed the seal on top of it. She then wrapped the\narticles in a fine cloth, sealed it with wax, and handed them to me, saying,\n“Act as if these were entrusted to you by the lama. Offer them to lama\nNgokpa and request the dharma.” She sent me to Zhung, and I departed,\nplacing my hopes in lama Ngokpa.\nAfter two days had passed, the lama asked his wife, “What is Great\nMagician doing now?”\n“He is on the road. I don’t know anything more than that,” she replied.\n“Where has he gone?”\n“He told me that although he had done so much work on the tower, you\ndid not give him the dharma but only much scolding and abuse.

The lama removed his\n\n--- PAGE 83 ---\nhat, returned a greeting, and said, “This is the manner of homage used by\ndisciples in the lineage of lama Marpa. The auspicious connection of his\narrival at this juncture in the dharma talk is most excellent. He will become\nmaster of all the dharma. Go ask who he is.”\nOne of the resident disciples came up to me and, recognizing me, asked,\n“Why have you come here?”\n“Lama Marpa is very busy. Since I am the only one he hasn’t had time to\nteach, I’ve come here to request the dharma. He has sent as his gifts\nNāropa’s ornaments and his ruby rosary.”\nThe disciple went up to the lama and said, “It’s Great Magician.” Then\nhe recounted my story. Overjoyed, the lama exclaimed, “Having Lord\nNāropa’s ornaments and rosary come to my home is as rare and as\nmarvelous as the Udumbara flower.12 We must greet them. We shall stop at\nthis fine place in the teaching. Disciples, fetch parasols, victory banners,\nand musical instruments, and come quickly. We must salute the layman\nGreat Magician.”\nI had remained at the place where I made prostrations, so a disciple\ncame and informed me. I later called the place where I made prostrations\nChaktsal Gang (Prostration Hill). I too saluted and at that moment a\nprocession of disciples came to greet me carrying an incredible display of\nparasols, victory banners, and musical instruments.\nWe reached the lama’s chambers. I offered prostrations and handed over\nthe gifts. His eyes filled with tears and he held the gifts up to his head and\nreceived their blessings. Next he placed these excellent sacred objects on\nthe shrine, giving them a place of central importance among very fine\nofferings. Then he read the letter aloud:\nTo Ngok Chöku Dorjé: I am entering closed retreat and Great Magician is\nimpatient. I am sending him to you to request the dharma, so grant him\ninitiation and teach him the oral instructions. As tokens of my permission to\ndo this I am sending Nāropa’s ornaments and his rosary made of ruby.\nLama Ngokpa said, “Since this is the lama’s command, I will certainly\ngive you initiation and oral instructions. I had thought I should invite you so\nyour arrival is a sign of the lama’s compassion. Many disciples are coming\nto me from Kham, Dakpo, Kongpo, and Yarlung. Evil men from Yepo and\nYemo in Dol steal their dharma provisions with impunity. Cast a hailstorm\nupon them.

The auspicious connection of his\narrival at this juncture in the dharma talk is most excellent. He will become\nmaster of all the dharma. Go ask who he is.”\nOne of the resident disciples came up to me and, recognizing me, asked,\n“Why have you come here?”\n“Lama Marpa is very busy. Since I am the only one he hasn’t had time to\nteach, I’ve come here to request the dharma. He has sent as his gifts\nNāropa’s ornaments and his ruby rosary.”\nThe disciple went up to the lama and said, “It’s Great Magician.” Then\nhe recounted my story. Overjoyed, the lama exclaimed, “Having Lord\nNāropa’s ornaments and rosary come to my home is as rare and as\nmarvelous as the Udumbara flower.12 We must greet them. We shall stop at\nthis fine place in the teaching. Disciples, fetch parasols, victory banners,\nand musical instruments, and come quickly. We must salute the layman\nGreat Magician.”\nI had remained at the place where I made prostrations, so a disciple\ncame and informed me. I later called the place where I made prostrations\nChaktsal Gang (Prostration Hill). I too saluted and at that moment a\nprocession of disciples came to greet me carrying an incredible display of\nparasols, victory banners, and musical instruments.\nWe reached the lama’s chambers. I offered prostrations and handed over\nthe gifts. His eyes filled with tears and he held the gifts up to his head and\nreceived their blessings. Next he placed these excellent sacred objects on\nthe shrine, giving them a place of central importance among very fine\nofferings. Then he read the letter aloud:\nTo Ngok Chöku Dorjé: I am entering closed retreat and Great Magician is\nimpatient. I am sending him to you to request the dharma, so grant him\ninitiation and teach him the oral instructions. As tokens of my permission to\ndo this I am sending Nāropa’s ornaments and his rosary made of ruby.\nLama Ngokpa said, “Since this is the lama’s command, I will certainly\ngive you initiation and oral instructions. I had thought I should invite you so\nyour arrival is a sign of the lama’s compassion. Many disciples are coming\nto me from Kham, Dakpo, Kongpo, and Yarlung. Evil men from Yepo and\nYemo in Dol steal their dharma provisions with impunity. Cast a hailstorm\nupon them. Then I will give you initiation and oral instructions.”\nI thought, “I am destined to perform evil deeds. If I cast a hailstorm, I\nwill receive the genuine dharma but will also accrue the karma of such a\nheinous crime. If I don’t cast one, it will amount to breaking the lama’s\ncommand and I will not get the dharma. There is no way I can avoid casting\n\n--- PAGE 84 ---\na hailstorm.”\nI gathered the materials, taking with me ritual substances charged by\nmantras, and left for the countryside. There I set to work and hail began to\nfall. In Yepo, I lodged in the home of an old woman, taking shelter from the\nrain. Lightning flashed. Thunder clapped. A dark cloud gathered and one by\none, then two by two, hailstones began to fall. Weeping, the old lady said,\n“What shall I eat when my crops are beaten down by hail?”\n“Surely, I am committing an evil deed,” I thought. Then I said, “Mistress,\nquickly draw the shape of your field.”\n“It is like this,” she said, and she drew an elongated triangle. I\nperformed a yogic gaze and covered the drawing with an iron pan. A tip of\nthe triangle remained uncovered and that part of the field was devastated by\nfierce winds. I was certain about the hailstorm and I went to look. The\ncentral mountain slopes of the two regions were all swept into deep\nravines. All the other fields were completely washed away. But the old\nwoman’s field was left standing fresh and unharmed except for the tip,\nwhich was struck by hail and then flattened by the rushing flood. In later\ntimes, hail never again fell upon that field, and it is said that the old woman\ndid not need to pay hail tax13 on the entire field but only on the tip that was\ndestroyed by the flood.\nThen I headed back. Along the way I met an old shepherd and his child\nwhose cows and sheep had been carried away by the flood. To them I said,\n“I did this. Do not attack lama Ngokpa’s disciples. If you attack them I will\ncontinue to cast hailstorms like this.” They conveyed this threat and the two\nregions thus respectfully paid reverence to the lama. They became his\npatrons and later offered him their service.\nI came upon the corpses of many small birds lying beneath a thicket and\ncorpses of birds and mice all along the road. I collected them as I went\nalong, filling the hood of my rain cover and the lower skirts of my cloak. I\npiled the corpses in a heap before the lama, and said, “Precious lama, I\ncame here for the genuine dharma, but have done only evil deeds. Look\nupon me, a terrible sinner, with compassion.” And I cried.\nThe lama replied, “Layman Great Magician, you need not worry so\nmuch.

Eleven months passed.\nThen the lama and his wife came, bringing lavish supplies for a ritual\nfeast. The lama said, “Son, for you to meditate for eleven months without\nyour cushion growing cold is most excellent. Now tear down the cell door\nand come beside your old father to rest your weary body and discuss the\nexperiences you have had.”\n“This is the real sustenance for my weary body,” I thought. “But since it\nis my lama’s command I must go.” As I began tearing down the door, the\ncell suddenly felt quite dear to me and I stood there reluctant to continue.\nJust then the lama’s wife came up and asked, “Son, are you coming?”\n“I cannot bring myself to tear down the cell door,” I replied.\n“There is nothing wrong,” she said. “In general, Secret Mantra\nemphasizes the importance of profound auspicious connections. More\nimportantly, the lama has a fiery temper so it will not do to mishandle this\nauspicious moment. Your mother will tear down the cell door, so come\nquickly.” She tore it down. Thinking that she was right, I came out.\nThe lama said, “The two of us, father and son, shall practice the rituals\nfor cultivating clear realization. Dakmema, prepare a ritual feast.” While\nwe were making the feast offering the lama asked, “Son, what certainty\nhave you gained about the oral instructions? Relax your mind and describe\nwhat kind of understanding, experience, and realization you have had.”\nFeeling great faith and devotion toward the lama, I knelt down and\njoined my palms in prayer. With tears streaming from my eyes, as a prelude\nto presenting my experience and realization, I first offered this sevenfold\nservice to the lama in song:\nI bow to your various emanation bodies \nDisplayed before impure disciples, \nAnd to your venerable enjoyment body \nRevealed to your circle of pure disciples.\n \n\n--- PAGE 96 ---\nI bow to your speech, at once audible and empty, \nWhich enunciates the eighty-four thousand true dharmas \nWith the sixty qualities of Brahmā’s voice \nTo each person in his own language.\n \nI bow to your mind, changeless reality body, \nWhich embraces all objects of knowledge \nWhile remaining unobscured by conceptual marks \nIn the space of the luminosity reality body.\n \nI bow down at the feet of great lady Dakmé, \nBirth mother of the buddhas of the three times, \nUnchanging selfless (dakmé) illusory body \nDwelling in the pure palace of reality’s expanse.\n \nI prostrate with unfeigned devotion \nTo the spiritual sons you have gathered, \nThe assembly of disciples who practice as taught, \nTogether with all of their followers.\n \nIn your presence I offer my body \nAnd whatever material offerings exist\n \nThroughout all realms of the universe. \nI confess each of my negative deeds. \nI rejoice in all forms of merit. \nI pray that you turn the great wheel of dharma. \nI pray that the glorious lama remain \nUntil life’s round is emptied. \nI dedicate my accumulated virtue to the benefit of sentient beings.\n“Having first offered the sevenfold service in this way,” I continued, “to\nmy sovereign master, I present the meager understanding I have gained\nthrough the utterly pure enlightened activity of the lama—inseparable from\nVajradhara—his consort and children, through the power of the blessings of\nhis immeasurable compassion, and through his unbounded kindness.

I also have Paṇchen Nāro’s\nexcellent prophetic command regarding the Kagyu teachings. You, my\nforemost disciples, go await your dreams.”\nLater, the senior disciples took note of their dreams and reported them.\nEveryone had dreams and some dreams were good, but none of the dreams\nrevealed a prophecy. I had a dream of four great pillars, which I described\nto the lama in this way:\nIn accordance with Lord Vajradhara’s command, \nTo the lama I set forth my dream from last night \nAnd the way it appeared before me. \nPlease lend an ear and listen to me.\n \nHere in the world’s broad and vast northern quarter \nI dreamt that there stood a grand mountain of snows. \nI dreamt that its glacial summit touched the sky. \nI dreamt that the sun and moon coursed round its peak. \nI dreamt that their light filled all of space. \nI dreamt that its base covered the whole of the earth. \nI dreamt that rivers ran down in the four directions. \nI dreamt that their waters satisfied all beings. \nI dreamt that the rivers drained into the sea. \nI dreamt that all manner of flowers bloomed forth. \nIn general, such was the dream that I dreamt. \n\n--- PAGE 102 ---\nI recount the dream to my lama, the three-times buddhas.\n \nIn particular, from this towering grand snowy mountain \nI dreamt to the east a great pillar was raised. \nI dreamt high on the pillar a great lion stood regal.\n \nI dreamt the lion’s turquoise mane spread open wide. \nI dreamt the claws of his four paws spread out on the glacier. \nI dreamt that his eyes gazed toward the heavens. \nI dreamt that the lion leaped about on the snow. \nI recount the dream to my lama, the three-times buddhas.\n \nI dreamt to the south a great pillar was raised. \nI dreamt high on the pillar a tigress riled herself up. \nI dreamt that the tigress’s striped fur stood on end. \nI dreamt that she smiled three times. \nI dreamt the claws of her four paws spread out through the forest. \nI dreamt that her eyes gazed toward the heavens. \nI dreamt that the tigress leaped about through the forest. \nI dreamt that the forest of pine groves were tangled. \nI recount the dream to my lama, the three-times buddhas.\n \nI dreamt to the west a great pillar was raised. \nI dreamt high on the pillar a large garuḍa hovered. \nI dreamt the garuḍa’s plume fanned open wide. \nI dreamt the garuḍa’s horns were raised to the sky. \nI dreamt that its eyes gazed toward the heavens. \nI dreamt the garuḍa flew off into space. \nI recount the dream to my lama, the three-times buddhas.\n \nI dreamt to the north a great pillar was raised. \nI dreamt high on the pillar a vulture hovered. \nI dreamt the vulture’s plume fanned open wide. \nI dreamt the vulture’s aerie was perched on a crag. \nI dreamt that unto the vulture a sole chick was born. \nI dreamt that the sky was filled with small birds. \nI dreamt that its eyes gazed toward the heavens. \nI dreamt that the vulture flew off into space. \nI recount my dream to the lama, the three-times buddhas.\n \nAre the omens of a dream such as this, I wonder,", "tokens": 1107, "page_debut": null}

I dwell in caves in uninhabited places, so I have no need\nfor a house. Even if I were a master of the entire world, I would still need\nto leave them aside at the time of death. So if I renounce these things now, I\n\n--- PAGE 129 ---\nshall find happiness in this and all future lives. Doing so, my conduct is\ncontrary to that of all other men, so you can say I am no longer a man.”\n“So is your conduct also contrary to all those who practice dharma?” she\nasked.\n“There are those who once fell prey to worldly pride and then, having\nlearned to preach on a few religious books, took pleasure in their own\ngains and in the defeat of others. Such people call themselves dharma\npractitioners and wear golden robes, all the while seeking as much wealth\nand fame as possible. I turn my back on all such people and always will.\nBut there are other dharma practitioners whose intentions and actions are\nnot like that. Even though they appear in the garb of their own tradition, I\ndon’t view their actions as being contrary to mine since we agree in our\nfundamental aims. But if they do not agree with my fundamental aims then\nthey are opposed to my practice.”\n“Never before have I seen a dharma practitioner like you, dressed more\nmiserably than a beggar. What kind of religious tradition requires dress like\nthis?”\n“It is the garb of the best of all religious traditions, the tradition called\n‘casting the eight worldly concerns to the wind in order to attain\nbuddhahood in this life.’”\nShe replied, “As you say, your practice and manner of dress and theirs\nare exactly the opposite. It seems one of them is not the dharma. Were they\nequally dharma, I would still prefer theirs.”\n“I don’t like the kind of dharma practitioners you worldly people favor.\nIt seems that even those practitioners who wear saffron robes, while in\nagreement with my fundamental aims, still retain a slight affinity for the\neight worldly concerns. Even if they do not, there is still an unimaginable\ndifference in the speed at which we can each attain buddhahood. This is\nwhat you don’t understand. Therefore, practice the dharma if you can. If\nyou can’t, then take the house and fields as I have already said and be off.”\n“I want neither your house nor your fields,” she replied. “Give them to\nyour sister. I shall practice dharma but I cannot follow a path like yours.”\nAnd with this she departed.\nMy aunt then learned that I had no interest in either the house or the\nfields. Several days passed and she thought, “Since he says he is following\nthe instructions of his lama, I shall see if I can acquire the fields for\nmyself.” She visited me carrying beer, meat, butter, and other foods and\nsaid, “The other day I behaved foolishly, but you, my nephew, are a dharma\npractitioner, so you should forgive me.

Practice virtuous conduct. \nSleep and afflictions, five poisons, oppress you.\nAfter scolding myself in this way, I meditated day and night and my\nspiritual practice thus increased. Three years passed in this way. I had a\nplan to eat one load of barley flour each year. But once that was used up, I\nknew my life would be in danger if I had nothing else to survive on. I\nthought, “Worldly men find one or two tenths of an ounce of gold and they\nrejoice, and when they lose it, they despair. But that can’t be compared to\ndying without attaining buddhahood. A body used to achieve buddhahood is\nmore valuable than even the whole third-order thousand-fold universe\nfilled with gold.18 It is better to die while continuing to practice than to\nbreak my earlier vow. What should I do now?” I decided I would not go\ndown to the village, but that I should search for some food to sustain my\npractice of austerities. Since it would be for the sake of dharma, this would\nnot break my vows.\nStepping out in front of Drakar, I found a delightful spot with a\ncommanding view where there was warm sun, excellent water, and many\nnettles growing. I moved over to it and stayed there living on nothing but\nnettles as I practiced. I had no clothes on my outside and nothing nutritious\nto sustain me inside. My body thus became like a skeleton and turned the\ncolor of nettles, covered with soft green hair. During this time I wanted to\nclutch the text the lama gave me and I placed it upon my head. When I did,\nmy stomach felt pleasantly full even though I had nothing whatsoever to eat,\nand I even belched. I was tempted to break the seal on the scroll and read it\nbut I received a sign that it was not yet the proper time so I set it aside.\nAbout a year had passed when several hunters from the market of\nKyirong appeared at my dwelling, having failed to kill any game.

Remain in your seat. \nGo off and your stride will be tripped up on stones.\nDon’t slacken, don’t slacken. Keep your head bowed. \nRelax and it all becomes futile and meaningless.\nDon’t sleep, don’t sleep. Practice virtuous conduct. \nSleep and afflictions, five poisons, oppress you.\nAfter scolding myself in this way, I meditated day and night and my\nspiritual practice thus increased. Three years passed in this way. I had a\nplan to eat one load of barley flour each year. But once that was used up, I\nknew my life would be in danger if I had nothing else to survive on. I\nthought, “Worldly men find one or two tenths of an ounce of gold and they\nrejoice, and when they lose it, they despair. But that can’t be compared to\ndying without attaining buddhahood. A body used to achieve buddhahood is\nmore valuable than even the whole third-order thousand-fold universe\nfilled with gold.18 It is better to die while continuing to practice than to\nbreak my earlier vow. What should I do now?” I decided I would not go\ndown to the village, but that I should search for some food to sustain my\npractice of austerities. Since it would be for the sake of dharma, this would\nnot break my vows.\nStepping out in front of Drakar, I found a delightful spot with a\ncommanding view where there was warm sun, excellent water, and many\nnettles growing. I moved over to it and stayed there living on nothing but\nnettles as I practiced. I had no clothes on my outside and nothing nutritious\nto sustain me inside. My body thus became like a skeleton and turned the\ncolor of nettles, covered with soft green hair. During this time I wanted to\nclutch the text the lama gave me and I placed it upon my head. When I did,\nmy stomach felt pleasantly full even though I had nothing whatsoever to eat,\nand I even belched. I was tempted to break the seal on the scroll and read it\nbut I received a sign that it was not yet the proper time so I set it aside.\nAbout a year had passed when several hunters from the market of\nKyirong appeared at my dwelling, having failed to kill any game. At first\nthey cried, “It’s a ghost!” and fled. I assured them I was a man and a\npractitioner. “It doesn’t seem like he is, but let’s see,” they said. The\nhunters returned and scoured the interior of my cave. “Where are your\nretreat provisions?” they demanded menacingly. “Give us some now and\nlater we will return it in kind. If you don’t, we’ll kill you.”\n“I have nothing but nettles,” I replied. “Lift this hermit up and see if he\n\n--- PAGE 136 ---\nhas anything. I have no fear of being robbed.”\n“We will not rob you. What would we gain by lifting up the hermit?”\n“You will acquire merit,” I said.\n“In that case,” they said, “lift him up.” They grabbed my waist and let me\nfall to the floor again and again. Even as my body, accustomed to ascetic\npractice, was filled with pain, I felt fierce, unbearable compassion and\nwept.\nOne of the hunters, who had stood by without causing harm, said, “Hey,\nyou all, he seems to be a genuine religious follower. And even if he’s not,\nyou don’t become a man by mistreating such a bag of bones like that. He\nhas not forced us to be hungry. Don’t do that!”\nThen to me he said, “Wondrous yogin, since I did not disturb you, place\nme under the protection of your meditation practice.”\nThe others said, “And those of us who did lift you up, place us under\nyour protection too.”\nOne of the hunters added, “Sure, but he’ll find a different way of\nprotecting you.” They burst out laughing and went away.\nI didn’t think of using magic but they eventually received the deities’\nretribution. It is said that the governor punished the hunters. The leader was\nexecuted and all the others, except for the individual who told them not to\nharm me, had their eyes put out.\nAfter a year or so had passed, my clothes were all worn out. I thought\nabout sewing together the ragged blanket, now in tatters, my aunt had given\nme as payment for my fields, the empty flour sacks, and the remnants of my\nclothing to make a coverlet for my cushion. But then I thought, “Were I to\ndie tonight, sewing this would be pointless. It would be better to meditate,”\nso I gave up the idea. Instead, I spread the blanket over the cushion and\nused it to wrap the lower part of my body. I dressed my upper body with\neach of the empty flour sacks. In this way, I used these materials to cover\nthe parts of my body that needed it most. When they could no longer protect\nme, I thought my renunciation had gone too far and that I should sew them\ntogether. But I could find neither needle nor thread, so I knotted together the\nthree ragged sacks, one each for the upper, middle, and lower parts of my\nbody, all of which I fastened with a jute rope around my waist. I did my\nbest wearing this by day. At night I covered the cushion with the ragged\nblanket and tatters of cloth and continued as best I could.\nIn this way I passed another year or so meditating. One day there arose a\nclamor of many voices. Looking out, I saw that several hunters, carrying a\ngood deal of meat, had appeared at the entrance of my cave.

But even\nwere I an emanation from the three lower realms, if you regard me as\nVajradhara or someone similar you will receive his blessings by virtue of\nyour devotion. Although this belief that I am an emanation comes from your\npure perception of me, there is no greater misunderstanding of dharma. This\nis because you do not recognize the greatness of perfectly practicing pure\ndharma.\n“In general, the greatness of genuine dharma is such that even an ordinary\nperson who carried out terrible sinful deeds, such as I did in the early part\nof my life, can eventually gain conviction in the law of cause and effect. If\nhe is then able to renounce this life and meditate without his three gates\nbecoming distracted, he can reach a state not far from attaining\nbuddhahood. In particular, if you are able to follow a properly qualified\nlama, you can then receive the initiations and oral instructions that\nintroduce one to nakedly perceiving—without obscurations of conventional\nthought—the essential points and heart-instructions of the short path of\nSecret Mantra; and if you can meditate on them, there is no doubt that you\nshall gain buddhahood in this life.\n“But if in this life you instead commit the grievous actions of the ten nonvirtuous deeds and the five heinous crimes, there is no doubt that\nimmediately after death you shall be reborn in the lowest hell.

But even\nwere I an emanation from the three lower realms, if you regard me as\nVajradhara or someone similar you will receive his blessings by virtue of\nyour devotion. Although this belief that I am an emanation comes from your\npure perception of me, there is no greater misunderstanding of dharma. This\nis because you do not recognize the greatness of perfectly practicing pure\ndharma.\n“In general, the greatness of genuine dharma is such that even an ordinary\nperson who carried out terrible sinful deeds, such as I did in the early part\nof my life, can eventually gain conviction in the law of cause and effect. If\nhe is then able to renounce this life and meditate without his three gates\nbecoming distracted, he can reach a state not far from attaining\nbuddhahood. In particular, if you are able to follow a properly qualified\nlama, you can then receive the initiations and oral instructions that\nintroduce one to nakedly perceiving—without obscurations of conventional\nthought—the essential points and heart-instructions of the short path of\nSecret Mantra; and if you can meditate on them, there is no doubt that you\nshall gain buddhahood in this life.\n“But if in this life you instead commit the grievous actions of the ten nonvirtuous deeds and the five heinous crimes, there is no doubt that\nimmediately after death you shall be reborn in the lowest hell. Because you\nhave no conviction about the law of cause and effect, you have little\nperseverance in practice.\n“If you have heartfelt conviction about the law of cause and effect, you\nwill fear the misery of the lower realms and wish to attain buddhahood. In\n\n--- PAGE 161 ---\nthat regard, it is possible for every ordinary or common person with\nperseverance to do as I have done: First, develop devotion for the lama.\nNext, persist in meditation on the oral instructions. Finally, persevere in\nnurturing your experience and realization. To suggest, once this is done, that\nsuch an individual is an emanation of a buddha or a bodhisattva is a sign\nthat you lack conviction in the short path of Secret Mantra. For this reason,\nhave conviction in the law of cause and effect. From the life stories of\nprevious masters, contemplate the cause and effect of actions, the faults of\nlife’s round, the difficulty of attaining a human rebirth endowed with\nleisure and opportunity, and the uncertainty of the time of death. Apply\nyourself to the practice of Secret Mantra.\n“I lived without food, clothing, or conversation. I strengthened my\nresolve. I punished my body. I meditated in the mountains with no concern\nfor my own suffering. And in the end, I gained great qualities of experience\nand realization. You too should follow my example and practice!”\nThus Milarepa spoke.\n \nThis was the seventh of the supreme deeds, the deed in which, in order to\npractice the lama’s instructions, he renounced this life and meditated\nundistractedly in the mountains with perseverance and severe austerity.", "tokens": 965, "page_debut": null}

There is\nthe cycle on Shendormo and Leksé Bum at Tsarma, and then the cycle on the\nimportance of remaining joyful at the time of death. There is the cycle on\nDüdül Pukmoché and the cycle on taking a stroll when the master and\nRechungpa went to Lapchi. Then, having returned, there is the cycle on\nRamding Nampukma. Then, while staying at Drö Puk of Nyanam at the\ninvitation of lay followers, the Jetsün narrated his life story. Following\nthat, there is the cycle on Rechungpa’s departure for Ü. There is the cycle\non his meeting with Dampa on the Tong Pass at the insistence of the ḍākinī\nSengé Dongchen. There is the cycle on the iron hook of compassion for the\ndead and repaying the kindness of his mother at Lezhing.

These are the eight heart-sons, the\nthirteen close-sons, and the four sisters. There are extensive cycles\nregarding how the master met each one.\nThird are the various cycles of story fragments. He described how he\nmet his heart-sons in a number of inner and secret fortresses but did not tell\nthe order in which they occurred. There are several cycles on answers to\nquestions of resident disciples and lay followers. There is a cycle on\nBonpori that occurred while Gampopa was staying with him. Then there is\nthe cycle on initiation and consecration when he went to Nyanam. There is\nthe cycle on Shendormo and Leksé Bum at Tsarma, and then the cycle on the\nimportance of remaining joyful at the time of death. There is the cycle on\nDüdül Pukmoché and the cycle on taking a stroll when the master and\nRechungpa went to Lapchi. Then, having returned, there is the cycle on\nRamding Nampukma. Then, while staying at Drö Puk of Nyanam at the\ninvitation of lay followers, the Jetsün narrated his life story. Following\nthat, there is the cycle on Rechungpa’s departure for Ü. There is the cycle\non his meeting with Dampa on the Tong Pass at the insistence of the ḍākinī\nSengé Dongchen. There is the cycle on the iron hook of compassion for the\ndead and repaying the kindness of his mother at Lezhing. There is the cycle\non his final testament given to lay followers of Tsarma and other people of\nNyanam. Then there is the cycle on Lharjé Yangngé at Tingri that occurred\nwhile on his way to Chubar. Then there is the cycle on Rechungpa’s second\ndeparture for Ü, after the Jetsün reached Chubar. There is the cycle on the\npatron Tashi Tsek at Lhadro in Drin. There is the cycle on his lay followers\nsuch as Dzesé Bum and Khuchuk at Drakar in Drin. There is the cycle on\nhis victory over the four demons at Drakmar Poto and the answers to\nquestions of a mantra practitioner. There is the cycle on how he displayed\nbodily miracles to the delight of his disciples.\nThere are an unimaginable number of such cycles, both well known and\nlittle known, in which he turns the wheel of dharma. In this way, he ripened\nand liberated those of highest capacity, beings with untold great fortune. He\nripened and taught the path of liberation to those of intermediate capacity.\nThose of least capacity he imbued with the firm intention to train in the\npractice of arousing the attitude of supreme awakening and in the\nbodhisattva discipline. Even those lacking fortune altogether he imprinted\nwith the inclination toward real virtue. Thus he performed the enlightened\nactivity of establishing them in the happiness of the gods and humans in the\nhigher realms.

So if\nyou wish to see the gods, strive to gather the accumulations and purify\nobscurations.

I will get\nready to welcome you.” He went on ahead and in an instant was gone.\nRechungpa continued along the path. When he reached Chubar he saw the\nresident disciples, students, and lay followers assembled at the Jetsün’s\ncave, presenting offerings to the corpse in a deep state of grief. Several\n\n--- PAGE 194 ---\nyoung repas who did not recognize Rechungpa prevented him from\napproaching the body. Anguished by this, he sang to the lama this song of\nthe sevenfold worship in a sorrowful melody:\nLord, three-times buddhas, protector of beings, \nFrom the depths of your great compassion and wisdom \nListen please to these lamentations \nOf me, your unfortunate servant, Rechung Dordrak. \nAy, here is my song of sadness, dear lama.\n \nLonging to meet with the father, I set out to find him. \nBut lacking in merit, the son did not see his face. \nLook upon me with compassion, my father so kind.\n \nTo you lord, in essence the three-times buddhas, \nEndowed with all wisdom, power, and love, \nThis beggar bows down and pays homage.\n \nI offer my practice of your instructions. \nI disclose my sins of wrong view and non-virtue. \nI rejoice in your unsurpassed deeds. \nI beg that you turn the wheel of profound dharma, \nAnd remain without passing into transcendence.\n \nI dedicate the virtuous roots of my meditation \nTo the completion of the Jetsün’s intentions. \nWith this dedication, may I the unfortunate one \nSee the face of the Jetsün’s corpse.\n \nOnce I was held in the lama’s favor. \nNow I cannot even honor his corpse. \nThough I haven’t the fortune to see him alive, \nAt least may I see the face of his corpse. \nAnd when I encounter the face of his corpse, \nEither in fact or in vision, \nI request the precious instructions for clearing obstructions \nWhile practicing tantra’s two stages.\n \nIf the father protects not with love his poor son, \nWho offers this heartfelt prayer, \nThen whom will his wisdom and love protect?", "tokens": 1069, "page_debut": null}

The\nnearest approach in Pali literature to these Dhamma-songs\nof Milarepa are the inspired utterances of Lord Buddha in\nthe Sutta Nipāta, Udāna and Itivuttaka (and also in the\nDhammapada), and the poems of gnosis spoken by the\ngreat bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs of the Noble Sangha, now\ncollected into such books as the Theragāthā and Therīgāthā.\nAmong the Bhikkhus living in the Buddha-time, Vaṅgīsa\nThera was outstanding for his inspired utterances (see Sn", "tokens": 322, "page_debut": null}

The mind inspired and illumined with\nthe knowledge of liberation (vimutti) pours forth its wisdom\nwith ease in the shape of verses of great beauty and deep\nsignificance. Such was the case with Lord Buddha and some\nof his immediate disciples, and later, such was the case with\nMilarepa.\nHis songs have been arranged here according to subject,\nthough no rigid classification is possible since many of the\nsongs deal with more than one aspect of the Dhamma. First\ncome Milarepa’s descriptions of some of his hermitages,\nthen songs on renunciation and the dangers of saṃsāra,\nfollowed by many more on impermanence. After them\ncome songs describing different aspects of saṃsāra—such as\nthe Six Realms of Birth; birth, old age, sickness and death;\nand home relatives and wealth. Next are songs relating to\npractice—advice on how to practise and warnings about\nwhat not to do; then upon the Six Pāramitā and other such\nhelpful qualities for practice as loving-kindness (mettā),\nstriving (viriya) and mindfulness (sati). Last of all come\nsongs describing aspects of Milarepa’s realization—his\ncontentment, happiness and non-attachment—concluding\nwith his blessings to his patrons.\nIt will be seen from the above sequence that the Teaching\nhere is not at all strange to Theravāda, including as it does\nthe Impermanence (anicca) of all things, states, people,\nplaces; that they are impermanent since they arise\ndependent upon conditions (paccaya); that what is\nconditioned, and therefore relative, is also devoid of", "tokens": 375, "page_debut": null}

Thus is the divorce of paṭipattidhamma or sīla (moral precepts) and samādhi (meditation),\nfrom pariyatti-dhamma or simply learning. Scholar-bhikkhus\nof Tibet were evidently, at that time, very able in arguing\nthe finer points of Buddhist philosophy and well-equipped\nwith logic to worst outsiders as well as fellow Buddhists in\ndebates. Somehow, in the welter of this study (and the\nTibetan Canon and its Commentaries are considerably more\nextensive than their lengthy Pāli counterparts), the urge to\npractise meditation, many of its foremost exponents were\nmasters not possessing the monk’s robes. This was true of\nthe spiritual forebears of Milarepa (his immediate Guru,\nMarpa and of the Indian yogis, Naropa and Tilopa). In\nseveral places he criticizes those bhikkhus, and indeed\nanyone, who studies the Dhamma just for intellectual\nsatisfaction or even for worldly advantage. Many sincere\nbhikkhus did approach him for meditation instructions and,\nthereafter, practised with him as their Teacher.

The greatest difference is that a bhikkhu in any\ncountry is bound to observe his Fundamental Precepts\n(Pātimokkha) which, as Milarepa did not have the bhikkhu\nordination (upasampadā), he did not have to keep.\nNevertheless, even a quick look at his life after he began his\npractice would reveal that he maintained scrupulously\nthose injunctions given him by his Teacher, Marpa the\nTranslator, as well as cultivating those twin bases of moral\nconduct in the Dhamma, Wisdom and Compassion (paññakaruṇā). Far greater than this are the resemblances between\nhim and the thudong bhikkhu. For instance, both praise\ncontentment with little, living remotely with utter\ndetachment from worldly affairs, great ability in meditation,\nand so on.\nThough he had not the formal ordination of a bhikkhu and\nwore not the monks’ robes, yet Milarepa was truly one gone\nforth (pabbajita). No one reading of his life and some of the\nsongs included here can possibly doubt this.

[6]\nThese various points, and perhaps others, could be raised to\npoint out that it is in the practice of Dhamma (paṭipatti) that\ndifferent schools of Buddhist thought are shown to have\nmany similarities. Finally, it is in realization of the Dhamma\n(paṭivedha) where all divergence ceases, since all the\nmethods practised by all the schools are without exception\naimed at the experience of Bodhi, or Enlightenment. If the\nDhamma is only studied from books, then many differences\nare seen separating the many Buddhist traditions but in\npractice there is very much in common. Since all Buddhists\nare urged to practise their Teachings, it is through this that\nharmony between the divergent traditions of Dhamma may\nbe discovered.\nThis little introduction may be concluded with a stanza\ndrawn from the autobiographical song, part of which is\nquoted above.
